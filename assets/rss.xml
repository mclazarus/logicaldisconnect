<p>My Grandfather was on the third wave at Utah Beach on June 6, 1944: D-Day he was a Staff Sargent in the 359th Infantry Regiment and was awarded the Silver Star, The Bronze Star, and other honors during his service. It&#39;s long been a goal of my mom&#39;s to make a visit to this place where he fought before he was married and had children. Just today we were able to do that and visit Utah Beach, Pointe du Hoc, Omaha Beach, an Omaha Beach museum, and The Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial for the Flag lowering ceremony. </p>
<p>I&#39;m glad I got to be there for this and given the threat to my Dziadziuś&#39; life in WWII I&#39;m glad I got to be at all. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been training here with John Parr for 7 years. I&#39;ve just recently gotten my diet right and am down 42 lbs since February and I&#39;ve never been stronger. Including that 18 year old football player I used to be. He definitely recovered faster than me and had better close range and low contrast vision. But I highly recommend SuperSlow training with John.</p>

<p>If this works I have a full mobile blogging post system for posting images and additional comments using shortcuts, Cloudflare Images, Drafts with a custom Action, GitHub, and GitHub Actions</p>
<p>Let the images start flowing down the makeshift trash can slide!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Back in Blog]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I know posting about blogs in your blog is boring and annoying. But I must say I&#39;m excited to have this system working and to be building myself a little ecosystem of tools that I can use to post to it.  Since I&#39;m relying on <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> for the hosting of this and GitHub actions to process and build it I&#39;m now adding an Action to Drafts to let me post stuff very easily.</p>
<p>My real goal here is to try and get some of the connection value I used to get out of Blogs and Twitter way back in the day. I know a ton of people continued writing their blogs and I&#39;m hoping to re-enter that space with my boring takes.</p>
<p>I know this is a big mess, and probably there was no reason to use Angular other than I wanted to learn it.  And I know there are broken links and posts everywhere and Blogs are dead, etc, etc.  But I don&#39;t care about any of that. I&#39;m enjoying coding a side project. I know I&#39;ll learn from it and I&#39;m enjoying at least the prospect of some connection.</p>
<p>So I moved this off of SquareSpace. They were fine, but I wasn&#39;t motivated to use it. Instead now that I have ownership of so much of the data and machinery in my Rube GoldBlog that I&#39;m excited about it.  If you have an interest in telling me I spelled something wrong, or the way I&#39;m using typescript is terrible. (See the code here: <a href="https://github.com/mclazarus/logicaldisconnect">mclazarus/logicaldisconnect</a>) or any of the other things you&#39;re dying to correct me on, simply tell me on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24063290/fediverse-explained-activitypub-social-media-open-protocol">The FediVerse</a>.  I hope to eventually support comments in this angular app, maybe they&#39;ll post to Fedi or something.  You can find me here: <a href="https://jawns.club/@mclazarus">@mclazarus@jawns.club</a>.</p>
<p>This post is what I call a two-fer. I post something and I also find out of the Drafts Action I wrote to post it works.  If so I&#39;ll be able to quick post from Drafts from my phone and that will be super fun.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[HALT LOAD]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>HALT LOAD</h1>
<p>Getting this to render as the first blog post in the new Logical Disconnect system is a celebration and a fun way to show that I&#39;m making progress.</p>
<h2>Backstory</h2>
<p>I worked at Unisys as a Drexel Co-op in 1996. I learned a ton about working in businesses and about how computers worked. My team was building an IO manager for an A-Series Mainframe. The chip on the so-called CIOM was designed by Unisys therefore had it&#39;s own opcodes based on a 108 bit word. So I would write microcode in a macro language. The specification of what the chip should do was written in C code called the flows. My job was to run tests written in ADA against a Windows emulator of the chip which would load up the latest version of the code and execute the tests.  When a test failed I had to either fix the test or fix the microcode.</p>
<p>While I was there the CIOM project achieved HALT LOAD which was a milestone in the boot lifecycle of the A-Series. It basically was an objective measure that we were no longer failing to almost boot. When this milestone was reached there was a celebration. There was a banner on the wall in the cafeteria congratulating the team for reaching HALT LOAD and they gave us ice-cream. The person shared a cube with named Steve had a cynical take on this and said, &quot;Here is where they give us milk and cookies.&quot;</p>
<p>I always like making obscure references and then trying to get them to catch on in groups I&#39;m in. Ideally they are meaningful in some way and the cynical take mixed with the actual objective measure is one of my favorite parts of this. I like to use HALT LOAD as a cry of celebration when I wish the work I was doing would go faster. So in some ways I&#39;m embracing the cynicism that could be present, but also I always use it in a time of celebration when I actually see a thing I&#39;m doing work.</p>
<p>Since I decided to take on this project of resurrecting my blog and taking back control from SquareSpace I wanted the first post before I even put code in the system to be a tribute to this.</p>
<p>So may your LOADS always HALT, or something. I actually am not very clear at all on the boot lifecycle of an A-Series mainframe and wasn&#39;t really at the time. But let&#39;s keep HALT LOAD alive regardless. I think some of the fun of obscure references is explaining it to others and bringing them into your circle.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Auspicious]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<img style="float: right; margin: 20px 20px 20px 20px;" width="400px" alt="electronic evaluation board attached to plexiglass labeled MOBILE UNIT" src="/assets/images/mobile_unit.jpeg" />
<p>A friend of mine teaches middle school and wanted some help.  He was looking for volunteers to be interviewed by students in his 8th grade class.  His goal was to teach communication skill and to give the students an opportunity to learn about possible careers.  The method was we would exchange letters, the student would then craft questions for the interview.</p>
<p>The letter shared by my paired student was a perfect jolt of spiritual fuel at just the time I could use it.</p>
<p>Over the past year or so I've been feeling bombarded by negativity from many online places I used to enjoy spending some time and attention.  I'd even started to consider—like many others—that social media and the internet at large are terrible.</p>
<p>The thing is I've spent a good portion of my life working on, learning, and enjoying the ways we can connect using the internet. So I was reluctant to give it up or consider it bad but the evidence was srtong.  Or so I thought.</p>
<p>The teacher knowing I'm an engineer paired me with a student who is very interested in electronics and video games. In his introductory letter he shared with me three youtube videos of him doing electronics work, modifying and repairing a broken Nintendo DS, modifying his Game Boy Advance, and building a handheld RetroPie setup in an altoids tin. The spark of curiosity and desire to overcome his obstacles as he worked through his project were intoxicating. And his willingness to share it with the world confident that in the same way he found other people's work and exploration useful others may find the same from him.  Finally the pride of accomplishment of a goal achieved were amazing to witness.</p>
<p>Seeing this at the same time I was to write a return letter about my career made me realize how important the Internet has been in my career and life overall and it helped me conceptualize why the thoguhts dwelling on how terrible a place it can be were really bringing me down.</p>
<p>Plus I could see what is possible to a young person intersted in electronics today.  I took apart plenty of technology when I was middle school aged but I didn't have youtube to help me learn what it was I was looking at and to share my findings so readily.</p>
<p>And I say the timing couldn't be more perfect.  I read this letter and wrote my response last night right before the scheduled presidential debate with two people I disagree with on many levels were going to put on a show and be adulated by the supporters for things I find horrifying.  </p>
<p>What I saw, what I've known for years, but can forget at times. People with a real thirst to pursue values and to achieve are what is important.  And the rest, the suffering, and the pain: "We never had to take any of it seriously, did we?"</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Planner Business]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>This year Michelle started as a travel agent working with <a href="http://www.mickeysdreamvacations.com/michelle-mcallister.html">Mickey’s Dream Vacations</a>.  To support her I plan to write a series of posts here with what I know about travel.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately for me and you and her that is somewhat limited but I think I can clear up a few things and then leave the rest to my wife who is the expert.</p>
<h3 id="the-money">The Money</h3>
<p>Well now the real issue is how does this work? How does the travel agent get paid?</p>
<p>At least for Michelle the deal is that she gets paid by the vendor.  This means if you book a Disney trip, or Universal package, or cruise she gets a commission.  </p>
<p>So this of course must drive up the cost to you. Well it turns out that it doesn’t.  The deals are the same if you book them or if an agent books them. And this makes sense because the commission is worth it to the people providing the trips and experiences just to get business.  This may be counterintuitive to you but my company has been very successful by <em>enabling the channel</em>.  Which is basically what you call aligning the interests between multiple parties so one does a bunch of the selling.</p>
<h3 id="why-bother">Why Bother</h3>
<p>Well okay fine it’s not going to cost you anything but why should you bother? </p>
<p>The best reason is expertise.  Some of these trips can be quite complicated.  If you’re going to do Walt Disney World there are many options, which lead to further choices and finally deadlines which are difficult to navigate unless you have a lot of experience.</p>
<p>Okay maybe you like the puzzle of figuring out all this stuff and optimizing your experience. Great! An agent can give you the relevant facts and do research to ensure you are getting everything you want out of your vacation. </p>
<p>Finally. You’re already paying for it. So no matter what deal you get you can have someone help you without any additional cost. Basically you’re choosing to leave free help on the table.</p>
<h3 id="why-michelle">Why Michelle</h3>
<p>Michelle is the smartest and hardest working person I’ve ever met. She is hungry to earn your business and your referrals.</p>
<p>So go like her <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MichelleMcAllisterMickeysDreamVacations">Facebook page</a> and look for a deal or reach out and just start figuring out what your next adventure will be.</p>

  <p> </p><p>I’m always seeking improvement in many areas.</p><p> </p><p>I want to be better at my work. I want to be physically stronger, faster, and have more endurance. I often have to prioritize in my pursuit of values and I don’t bemoan this as a necessary evil, I try to embrace the limitations of time and attention and fill them with only the best things.</p><p> </p><p>However&nbsp;I’m noticing an area that is extremely value dense but I often neglect for the comfort of the busyness of other things. Items of reflection and introspection. &nbsp;</p><p> </p><p>I happened to notice afew of the photos and videos I took the week of Christmas and spent a few moments looking at them.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Lights out twenty fourteen]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I'd have liked to put a nice highlight reel together for 2014 and talk about my big plans for 2015. I've had plenty of highlights and I have plenty of big plans but I didn't take the time to examine them and write it out.</p>

<p>The last year especially has felt extremely hectic at times and I think one of the things I'll focus on in the beginning of 2015 is trying to minimize that.  To drop the comfort of busy and be even more ruthless in my priorities. And finally to regularly reflect on how things are going.</p>

<p>I've had a great twenty fourteen.  Twenty fifteen will be great too.</p>

<p>Lights out!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ninety in the books]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I posted a while ago about <a href="http://logicaldisconnect.org/blog/2014/10/ruthless-39-of-90">my current health kick</a>.  I successfully finished 90 days on Sunday.  </p>

<p>I noticed partway through that there were some slight issues.  I think I was doing too much gym leading to a flare up of plantar fasciitis and there were a few days where I needed a break.  Finally I have a tendancy to backslide into eating sugary snacks after sustained exercise routines, rationalizing that I've earned it.</p>

<p>I decided to take a week off from the gym to let me recover a bit and refocus on the non-snacking since it undermines my primary goal.</p>

<p>The primary number: I lost 31 lbs.  Down from 254 lbs to 223.  This is basically my pre-marriage, pre-child weight back when I was studying Kempo after losing about 80 lbs between 11/2001 - 5/2002.</p>

<p>I'm going to take 5-7 days off from the gym and then get back to work.  My goal is to get to 190 lbs and emboldened by my recent success, I think I can do it by my birthday.</p>

<p>I'd put in a count of gym visits but <a href="http://lift.do">Lift</a> appears to be down, but as a guess I think I went to the gym about 75 out of 90 days.  Probably too much, but it pumps me full of energy and I enjoy it.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Objectivity of the bystander]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>If you would just take yourself out of the line of fire, you will think more clearly. That's easy for me to say.  Sure it's easy to say I'm not talking about taking fire at all.  I'm talking about thinking and communicating. In other words, working.</p>

<h3 id="hereswhatimean">Here's what I mean</h3>

<p>Some time ago an awesome co-worker was planning a twenty-seven hour day involving at least five acts of heroism.  Something like getting in early and preparing for a late-night maintenance, then travelling to another office for some meetings and then going back to finalize preparations before going home to eat and then to come back and participate in the overnight work.  I think <a href="http://slayhod.tumblr.com/post/43144917339/hunter-has-stolen-the-guide-for-ahod-preparation">this</a> was the plan.</p>

<p>I didn't come up with this plan so I wasn't invested.  I couldn't understand why the meetings were important because I didn't promise to be there.  It seemed crazy.  So we threw out all the time-wasting stuff and made that day a little less painful.</p>

<p>I was certain I would have come up with the same plan.</p>

<h3 id="finebutwhataboutbeingyelledatbyyourboss">Fine, but what about being yelled at by your boss?</h3>

<p>I watched it happen. There was no yelling. There was a challenging question.  The kind of collaborative question you'd use to find a flaw in a plan and make it better. And it was asked by the boss. The room went still. Everyone stiffened. The answers that followed were defensive, meant to shut down the challenge.</p>

<p>It was easy to see because I didn't draw any conclusions about where the question was leading. I didn't infer any judgment about my work.  I wasn't asked.</p>

<p>However, I know I never saw the benevolence and collaboration in this type of questions when I was asked.  I would also go on defense.</p>

<h3 id="howtostandby">How to stand by</h3>

<p>How do I get to the essence of this? How do I wield this super-power of objectivity?  How do I take myself out of the line of fire?</p>

<p>I don't know.</p>

<p>But I think I can get way better at everything when I find out.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ruthless 39 of 90]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The last 38 days plus today have been pretty good on a few fronts.  I've let work keep me from really focusing on my health for years.  But something about September 2nd made me commit to ruthlessly stick to a few simple rules and it's been going great.</p>

<h3 id="rule1sleepatleast7hourseverynight">Rule 1: Sleep at least 7 hours Every night.</h3>

<p>I've tried for a long time to "try and get around 8 hours of sleep a night," forever.  But I never picked a number and set it in stone and did everything I could to stick to it.  Over the past 39 days I've accomplished this goal 38 times.  (The morning after the Eagles Monday night game is my lone miss).</p>

<p>This was the hardest rule to follow and also I think the most beneficial.  Because of rule 3 I was getting up early, so I had to make sure I was in bed going to sleep no later than 10:10, every night.  In a hectic life working at a growing company and with a family, this means cutting out time where I can actually sit quietly and think or work on my own projects.  </p>

<p>I think this has been the most beneficial.  Getting sufficient sleep is like discovering a cognitive and emotional super power.  I'm more effective and more relaxed.</p>

<h3 id="rule2trackeverythingieat">Rule 2: Track everything I eat.</h3>

<p>I use MyFitnessPal on my phone and I just put everything in there.  I also set a calorie goal in there and try to hit it (ignoring exercise).  The goal is a side-effect and natural consequence of tracking.  I find myself incapable of tracking something and not trying to hit a goal.  </p>

<p>This is because I really want to lose weight, and the only thing I've found to be effective is being very particular about what I eat.  So I focus on hiting 1670 calories a day or fewer.</p>

<p>There have been a few times this was close to being missed.  But I've done it every day since 9/2.</p>

<h3 id="rule3gotothegym6daysaweek">Rule 3: Go to the gym 6 days a week.</h3>

<p>Now the rule is basically daily, because it's easier to stick to.  I work best when I try to do something every day.  If I had it 3 or 4 days a week it wouldn't work.  I've gone 33 out of 39 days.  So I'm right on track.</p>

<p>I enjoy working out, and feel much more energetic throughout the day when I do.  The only way I can fit this into my life daily is to do it first thing in the morning.  So I've been getting up at 5:10 almost every weekday and a bit later on the weekends (the LA Fitness gyms near me open at 7 or 8) and getting it in first thing.  Also this does help with Rule 1, because I am usually tired by 10 anyway.</p>

<p>I'm seeing improvements in my numbers and feeling good.</p>

<h3 id="sowhat">So what?</h3>

<p>I'm letting the hard structure of these three priorities drive my days.  I need to fit everything in around them, and it's very clarifying.  And I've been ruthless doing it.  Not succumbing to whim or letting anything else drive my decisions. I've lost 17 lbs in that time, and at almost 40 days in I feel like this is pretty sustainable.</p>

<p>I picked 90 not because I'll magically stop then, but simply to have a goal.  See what I accomplish in that time and then decide what I want to do next.  At this point I'll probably just sign up for another 90.</p>

<p>But it's not been easy.  Looking back, it feels easy.  But I paid close attention to all the small decisions that I've had to make to keep up with this committment.  And at each new decision in favor sticking with it, it does get easier.  But that doesn't mean it's easy.  It's been hard work.  I think someone who commits to a program like this can do it, but, it's an ongoing process and not a single big decision.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Audible SciFi Sale recommendations]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Once I had children and continued to fill my life with values, it
became difficult to make the time to read even though I've loved
reading as long as I can remember. Then I discovered
<a href="http://audible.com/">Audible</a> and it was love of books and not music that drove
me to buy my first iPod in 2005.  </p>

<p>Today I still do most of my fiction reading using Audible since I can
do it during my commute, washing dishes, or any other mostly-mindless
home maintenance task.  So if you aren't using Audible, I whole
heartedly recommend signing up and taking advantage of their free
trials.</p>

<p>This post is really for people who already are using Audible.</p>

<p>They currently are running a <a href="http://www.audible.com/mt/SuperSciFi_ALL">Super Sci-Fi Sale</a> Through the end of
the day May 10, 2014, where they have over 100 books available for
$6.95 each.  I paged through like I do many of their sales and found
they had a number of books I want or that I've read and enjoyed and wanted
to dash off something quick to recommend to others.</p>

<p>So here is the list, some of these I've read.  Others are on my
wishlist or I recognize the authors and think they might be worth
looking at.  Other than that grouping they are in no particular order:</p>

<h2 id="read">Read</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/Assignment-in-Eternity-Audiobook/B007XU32MS">Assignment in Eternity</a>, Robert A. Heinlein: I always recommend
everything Heinlein wrote, plus this was narrated by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balki_Bartokomous">Balki</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/A-Canticle-for-Leibowitz-Audiobook/B005F5ZBRC">A Canticle for Leibowitz</a>, Walter Miller: good classic
SciFi, read it years ago on advice of my father and enjoyed it.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/The-Mote-in-Gods-Eye-Audiobook/B002V5GWHM/">Diplomatic Immunity: A Miles Vorkosigan Novel</a>, Lois McMaster
Bujold: The Vorkosigan saga is very enjoyable.  This is book 14 in
the series so you have quite a bit of work to catch up to it, but
you might as well grab this one inexpensively now!  This is not one
of those series that I suffer from sunk costs, I liked each book.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Classics/Frankenstein-Audiobook/B00FQRCM9O">Frankenstein</a>, Mary Shelley: A classic.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/Little-Fuzzy-Audible-Audiobook/B002V0A8PE">Little Fuzzy</a>, H. Beam Piper: I actually listened to the version of this that came with <a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/Fuzzy-Nation-Audiobook/B004YXLK7G">Fuzzy Nation</a>, John Scalzi and I hated the Scalzi retelling of the story, but found the original Piper version to be a much better telling, where the Scalzi story was crude and obvious and pumped full of a certain political view that all corporations and any selfishness is evil, the Piper story suffered none of this and actually told an interesting story.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/Reamde-Audiobook/B005PMU12U">Reamde</a>, Neal Stephenson: I thankfully never got hooked on World of Warcraft, but got to enjoy machine guns and intrigue surrounding a video game world in this book. It was crazy at times, but I enjoyed it.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/The-Dreaming-Void-Audiobook/B002V0PW2I">The Dreaming Void: Void Trilogy Book 1</a>, Peter F. Hamilton: I listened to the <a href="http://www.audible.com/series/ref=a_pd_Sci-Fi_c2__1_sa?asin=B006K1M4YI">Commonwealth Saga</a> and <a href="http://www.audible.com/series/ref=a_pd_Sci-Fi_c2__1_sa?asin=B006K1NGAE">The Void Trilogy</a> and recommend them both.  I'd probably listen to the Commonwealth Saga first, but you can start here if you'd like.  I think this is what they call a space opera, and I approve.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/The-Lost-Fleet-Dauntless-Audiobook/B002VAGN62">The Lost Fleet: Dauntless</a>, Jack Campbell: The Lost Fleet series was another long series that if you like space nerdery, is awesome.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="haventread">Haven't Read</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/Beowulfs-Children-Audiobook/B009NICUEY">Beowulf's Children</a>, Larry Niven, Jerry Pournelle, Steven
Barnes: I haven't read this, but read something else by Larry Niven
and Jerry Pournelle called <a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/The-Mote-in-Gods-Eye-Audiobook/B002V5GWHM">The Mote in God's Eye</a> and
enjoyed it so I think this one is probably worth a shot.</li>

            <title><![CDATA[Delicious Time]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Surprisingly I didn't trip over my father's many copies of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Stranger-Strange-Land-Robert-Heinlein/dp/0441788386/logicaldiscon-20">Stranger in a Strange Land</a>. I discovered Robert Heinlein through a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Notebooks-Lazarus-Long-Robert-Heinlein/dp/0876544731/logicaldiscon-20">The Notebooks of Lazarus Long</a> sitting on a bookshelf. I was immediately enamoured with the contents. My favorite quote from that book is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Everything in excess! To enjoy the flavor of life, take big bites. Moderation is for monks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I considered it a challenge. Life is short, there are so many great things to do. As a result I've often taken on way more than I should.  Aside from wearing myself down a bit from time to time—and needing a few days to recover and then dig out—the results have mostly been spectacular.</p>

<p>And although I want to do all the things, I've developed the skill of saying "no" to things that would distract me, things that would be a <a href="http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/sacrifice.html#order_1">sacrifice</a>.  For the most part I'm able to do that, but I do make mistakes and once I have agreed to something it is nearly impossible for me to quit.  My emotional reaction to stopping or scaling back is like I'm losing something invaluable.  So I'll double down and fight for it, this of course reinforces the idea that the thing I am fighting for is a tremendous value, and therefore makes the emotional reaction to giving up even stronger.</p>

<p>Through some of my work I've long known that I had parts of it that I did not enjoy, but I considered it an important part of the job.  And I love my job, so like any other hard thing I'd face these are things I would learn about, improve my skill, and become an expert.   And with mastery would come the joy.</p>

<p>Certain aspects of my job required me to invent, fight for and prioritize a wide range of activity and tasks which would be in competition for limited resources. This is known as management.  And management is hard, I honestly can't understand how people are able to do it.  I think many engineers and software developers can't, notice all the dance about getting business requirements and business decisions when they are building things.  Because more often than not the business requirements make little sense to them at first so all the processes are built around just taking them as a given and trying to understand how to meet them.  And apparently when your job title at the startup is Vice President, management is where you are headed when success hits whether it seems that way or not in the beginning.  </p>

<p>Often I couldn't fully understand all the moving parts of the things I needed to manage, but I thought to be successful that I must understand all of these things.  The mind of the engineer needs to understand everything.  Additionally the business and my boss would seemingly demand heroics as evidenced in my frustration driven post <a href="http://logicaldisconnect.org/blog/2012/7/disconnect-the-batphone">Disconnect the Batphone</a> written in July last year.  And I would oblige using the skills that had served me so well.  Analyze and understand all the details and pitch in and work hard.  Trade sleep, trade personal time, trade sanity.  </p>

<p>And unfortunately it doesn't fail immediately, as a matter of fact, it can look suspiciously like success.  You look like you are on top of everything, until suddenly you can't work hard enough to keep up.  And what I've learned about scaling problems is that it's not only the thing that pushed you past the limit that suffers, it's everything and it's all at once, even though it will often take a long time to figure out that all those things are suffering. You develop bad habits for skipping steps or dropping things that are urgent.  You start to treat everything like crisis <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_triage_and_rapid_treatment">triage</a> regardless of how important you <em>know</em> it is.  The fact is you are so set-upon by everything that you don't actually know it is important, your hierarchy of importance gets over-simplified and you start making some real bone-headed decisions.</p>

<p>There are of course management skills.  But they most be learned and practiced and mastered.  But for that to happen you need to be interested in actually mastering management.  </p>

<p>I've always known I didn't want to be a manager, at least not at a high level.  I've been successful leading teams, but only ones where I'm in the trenches doing the work as well, and the management is less than 10% of the time.  In most cases meta-work I would need to do anyway if I were doing it all alone.  But somehow I didn't know.  Again there is the challenge, it goes with the title.  You can pep-talk yourself with cool phrases like "stepping up."  And of course there is the money.  In most cases management upside in money comes with significantly more money than that of even a team lead.  So it's easy to rationalize to yourself that it's the best thing for you.</p>

<p>So here I am, VP of Engineering at a company having astounding growth, and I am completely out of control and hate my job.  This is success?  If we are doing so well, why aren't I giddy with joy? What the hell is wrong with me? What do I do?  </p>

<p>Eventually I tell my boss I can't be VP, I want to continue working there, but I cannot do the job.  I know it is an immediate step but a process of getting someone in place to do the work that I am failing to do, but already I feel tremendous relief.  </p>

<p>How did I figure it out?  I'm not entirely sure.  It's one of the reasons I'm writing this to explore that.  I think I got pushed passed the point where it was obvious to even me when I was too busy to notice much of anything.  But I think it was noticing the distinct lack of joy in my work.  </p>

<p>I didn't dread going to work, I don't think.  But I didn't love it either.  In fact for many more days than not, I hated every minute of it.  I liked the work that was getting done, but I hated my role in it.  It wasn't clear to me always, and I would grab snatches of enjoyment which helped kept understanding out of my grasp.</p>

<p>So I was guided by a premise of <a href="http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/duty.html">duty</a> to my family, and to achieving wealth, and in doing what was best for my employer, and the job I was doing.  When I should have been seeking my happiness all along.  There is <a href="http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/trader_principle.html#order_2">no conflict of interest</a>.  I thought I understood these things before, but I understand them quite a bit better now, or will when I finish reviewing and introspecting how I let things get so difficult for myself.  I'm not sure exactly what it was but my boss did say something to me in a conversation that helped me to realize I wasn't happy.</p>

<p>My favorite book ever written is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fountainhead-Ayn-Rand/dp/0451191153/logicaldiscon-20">The Fountainhead</a> and there is a certain quote early in that book that is apt here.  The main character Roark is speaking with the Dean of the school of architecture where he was just expelled and says: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"But you see," said Roark quietly, "I have, let's say sixty years to live. Most of that time will be spent working. I've chosen the work I want to do. If I find no joy in it, then I'm only condemning myself to sixty years of torture. And I can find the joy only if I do my work in the best way possible to me. But the best is a matter of standards—and I set my own standards. I inherit nothing. I stand at the end of no tradition. I may, perhaps, stand at the beginning of one."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know the work that brings me joy, it's time to get on with it.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Bums Rush]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I've been rushed lately due to work, normal family things and other personal projects.  As such I've just discovered something I need to remind myself.  That is to slow the hell down so as not to come across as a bum.</p>

<p>I pride myself on understanding technical issues no matter how I learn of them.  I'll sit and think and re-read the ticket or bug.  Or I'll ask questions always building up the example in my head, going step-by-step and ensuring I am clear of the problem and my understanding of the technical system.</p>

<p>I recently have found myself jumping to conclusions and launching right into a response to people instead of careful consideration.  This is most prevalent with email, but I've done it in face-to-face conversations and even on twitter.  When I go back and read a tweet and realize all the context is actually there and my response was way off base it makes me realize some real slowing down is in order.  </p>

<p>Additionally I read a friends blog post: <a href="http://ip-sp.blogspot.com/2013/09/libtards-teabaggers-and-other-stuff.html">Libtards, Teabaggers and other stuff</a> which reminded me not to assume people I disagree with are idiots.  And for now if I have the time and come across what appears to be a vitriolic comment somewhere by someone I know I may ask questions to learn the person's position.  It has been a nice change of pace today to ask a few questions especially in light of the highly charged conversation about Government shutdown and new health care laws.  </p>

<p>Getting some reasonable answers made me feel a little less isolated  and silently annoyed.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Unremarkable Bisy Backson]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I don't think this is a great article, <a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/2013/04/03/you-can-be-busy-or-remarkable-but-not-both/">You Can Be Busy or Remarkable—But Not Both</a>.  But when I read it—after a tremendously busy day—it struck a chord.  Plus I couldn't resist a title reference to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tao-Pooh-Piglet-Boxed-Set/dp/014095144X/logicaldiscon-20">Tao of Pooh</a> after seeing the guy referenced in the article was some dude named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Tao">Tao</a>.</p>

<p>I read something that said <em>being lost</em> is not about not knowing where you are, but giving too much focus and anxiety to where you are not.  I don't have any idea what the origin of this was, maybe some quote in my High School yearbook.  </p>

<p>I think often the sense of anxiety that accompanies being busy is about knowing all the things you aren't doing and letting that fill up your mind.  Or allowing your mind-reading of other people's expectations to dictate how you feel about your life.  These things all are awful ideas.</p>

<p>Anyway I'm feeling a inspired to spend a more of of my time trying to relax, be realistic, and have some fun.</p>

<p><em>Update: I read what I wrote and was completely confused, so I reworded some things.  See I was tremendously busy yesterday and my brain doesn't work anymore.</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Reflection on beginnings]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I enjoyed Michael Lopp's article <a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2013/04/07/an_introduction_to_you.html">An Introduction to You</a>, specifically this part:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are in an incredible hurry building important things and have no time for nuance. We're impatient. We're busy. We want everything to move faster, so we make huge, comforting assumptions and slap easy to understand labels on complex concepts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Though I've been thinking little about the idea of oversimplifying and therefore over or under estimating the contribution of a new employee. Rather the quoted section made me think about how much is often missed in the "incredible hurry" when building products and the systems and processes to support a business.</p>

<p>It would have resonated more with me if he had written the exact same article but if it were not about an employee, but a new technology being integrated into the same busy-worshiping company culture.</p>

<p>This Radio Flyer was an excellent investment. </p>

<p>I would help my two little girls carefully climb into the seats. Make sure the stuffed friends, drinks and sunscreen were down in the ample room by their feet and we'd walk the half a mile to Roslyn Park and play on the playground. We'd make up chasing games where we'd be heroes protecting the park. And we'd order "Cherry Whipples" from the little counter under the climbing wall. All of this was probably four years ago.</p>

<p>Just recently I created a little spark of interest in X-Men reading to Ashley on the flight home from Disney and she has just fanned that spark into the full flame of obsession that today has even overtaken her sister.  So after Michelle and I put the trampoline together today (in record time) we played X-Men all afternoon.  Part of this somehow entailed squeezing some much larger little people into the Radio Flyer again. </p>

<p>And even though we're all older—and all have many more super important things to do—somehow a playing all day like the wagon was still a perfect fit.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Better all the time]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Someone once told me that raising children would have good times and some rough times, but that the overall trend was always upward in his experience.  After 8 years and 4 months I am in full agreement with him.</p>

<p>And it's nothing huge that makes me say that.  I suspect it would probably qualify as boring or at least plain evening for lots of folks.  But I sat and read some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Astonishing-Whedon-Cassaday-Ultimate-Collection/dp/0785161945/logicaldiscon-20">X-Men comics</a> with Ashley and then sat and read a chapter of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Watership-Scribner-Classics-Richard-Adams/dp/1442444053/logicaldiscon-20">Watership Down</a> with Allison before they went to bed.  And this is the type of stuff I couldn't wait to do when they were born.  Share my interests, discuss the various characters ask and answer questions.  </p>

<p>It was a great night.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>One of my favorite <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w">podcasts</a> spent their <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/78">whole show</a> talking about this article.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Get comfortable with the idea that you won’t know what’s good until it’s already happened.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's a very good article on working when you don't have any idea what your doing.</p>

<p>It's convinced me that I should be listening to the whole back catalog of <a href="http://www.radiolab.org">Radiolab</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Don't Think Again]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The challenge in doing creative work is understanding and managing limits.  The most obvious limit is the amount of time you have to work.  However, even if you could somehow remove all interruptions and practical concerns you couldn't possibly do high quality creative work for 18 or even 10 straight hours a day.  You only have a fixed amount of creative energy to use before you need to relax and renew that energy store.  Even if you're young, highly motivated or if you <a href="http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/184/663/drink-all-the-coffee.png">drink all the coffee</a>, there is no sense in working beyond that limit.  The work you do will either be junk or your mind will freeze up and slide you right into procrastination mode.  Sometimes you may be able to push hard and get another hour or two but this usually comes at the expense of tomorrow.  This creative energy is your most precious resource.  There are many ways you can waste that energy but I think a very insidious way is by inventing new ways to repeat yourself.  When you do creative work you are inventing not only the thing you make, but also a way of framing the problem.  To do any of this you have to think.  When you complete your work you will forget that thinking.  The next time you work on a similar problem you will waste energy re-thinking it.  Any work you do isn't really done until you can repeat it.</p>

<p>Maybe one of your many responsibilities is fixing broken technology.  You can treat each incident as separate, start from scratch, and try to determine what things you need to know about the problem.  Then you can hunt down evidence and follow the leads from the symptoms, take broken notes, and you will eventually build a solid mental picture of what is wrong and a possible solution.  As an alternative, you could automatically do a standard workup, and get some crucial statistics about the problem like the equipment involved, time, software versions, and captures of log files.  It would be as easy creating a form for yourself to fill out.  This standard format for reporting your findings is good if you work as part of a team, but even if you don't this can give you a head start on the problem and let you save your creative thinking for the hard part.</p>

<p>Or you wish you were a writer of some sort—be it books, blog posts or documentation.  You could just sit down and write what catches your fancy when you feel like it.  You might be pretty successful.  Or you might never find yourself writing; especially if writing is your second, third, fourth or tenth job.  You could decide it's important enough to schedule 30 minutes every day to move it forward a little bit.  You could formalize it further and create a rough outline of your writing process, developing a progression that starts at finding an idea and maps next steps to the end result.  Then you can really use short bursts of work daily, because you have a framework to let you jump right into the actual work.  For example, after not writing for years it was only by giving myself permission to write for a short block of time every day that I created this site.</p>

<p>You may rebel against this idea by thinking that working to a checklist is dooming yourself to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogon">boring bureaucratic work</a>.  Or maybe you see this as selling out and turning yourself from <a href="http://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/12/26">a creative person into a drone of a factory worker</a>.  If you don't give yourself a checklist to follow, then you are choosing to waste your creative energy on a solved problem—a problem that <em>you</em> solved already.  If you've come up with a way to write an article, why throw that away and start fresh with the next article?  Why not start with that scaffolding in place next time to let your creativity soar in new ways you didn't have room or energy for last time, because you were busy inventing the scaffolding?  You are going to do the work in some way.  Why not be serious and deliberately choose the way you are going to do it?</p>

<p>And the most important advantage to this type of approach is you can build on your framework.  You can build gradual improvement into the way you do everything.  If the next time you do some work you take a minute at the end and think about how you can do it better next time, you will be giving the <a href="http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/124/c/e/if_a_future_you____by_zeptozephyr-d3flawx.jpg">future you</a> a head-start.  If you don't do this, you are choosing to put a limit on your best by not recognizing and embracing the fact that you have a limit on your best that you can do in one sitting.</p>

<p>The only thing you need in order to take advantage of this idea immediately is a notebook that you know you'll look at again.  And the next time you finish a task, open that notebook, set a timer for 5 minutes and answer one question in full sentences, "how can I make this better next time?"</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Leaving work at 5:30]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>A few interesting things in this article.  </p>

<p>I don't advise playing the game Sheryl Sandberg was playing trying to look like she was working more than she was, but I certainly understand the pressure.  </p>

<p>Also really liked the idea attributed to Marrisa Meyer. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you resent the fact that you don’t eat dinner every night at 8 then you will get burnout and your work will not be as good.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact is you can only do so much so you have to ruthlessly prioritize.  And if you resent the fact that you can't do everything with unrealisticly high quality you'll just invite more pain and anxiety.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Here is a story that illustrates exactly the type of work decisions that led to this site.  Daniel's article focuses on the lack of empathy in the person who questions his start time.  I do think her reaction was unjust and I also think the young heroic Daniel took a physical and emotional beating that is better avoided.  </p>

<p>I completely understand the <em>need</em> to continue working on an active problem—especially when all the distractions are gone.  But I suspect he probably paid for that hard work in more ways than being insulted by a co-worker.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Disconnect the Batphone]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>It didn't work. In frustration you reach for your cup of tea and find only the dregs, long cold.  You write another email to your co-workers explaining why the latest attempt at a fix failed.  Usually writing it out helps you think of something else to try.  Nothing new comes to mind.  It goes in the Sent folder next to the other three un-replied-to messages from tonight.</p>

<p>You lean back and close your eyes trying not to think about the call from your boss. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Look, I know it's probably complex and hard but we really don't care about the details, we just need it to work.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Facing a problem alone has never bothered you, but you're not alone are you?  Your wife and children are sleeping upstairs.  If you can't figure this out and the company collapses, then what happens to them?  Certainly not that trip to Disney or the American Girl dolls for Christmas.</p>

<p>Opening your eyes you see it's 2:37 AM.  You've got nothing left and sleeping is better than feeling sorry for yourself.  Standing, you reach for your mug. </p>

<p>The flash comes.</p>

<p>You're back at the keyboard, leaning forward.  You see the connection. You're not sure yet.  But you are sure—you've never been more sure of anything.  You laugh.  It's so simple.  You put the patch together and push it to production.  It's fixed.  You were so stupid not to see it sooner, but that doesn't matter, it only matters that it works.  You write your triumphant email.  Wired, you sit and watch it work.  You finally head to bed after four.</p>

<hr />

<p>Instead of a hero's greeting when you enter the office you are ushered into a the conference room and grilled about the fix.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>What makes you so sure it won't happen again?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are happy to explain.  But no matter how clearly you explain the situation the hostility and uncertaintly remains.  A wild thought occurs to you; they seem dissapointed that your fix hasn't retroactively wiped the problem out of existence.  You realize again—you don't understand people.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>So what is the status of your current project?  We'll need to catch that back up.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Current Project?</em>  You vaguely remember you were working on something else before the crisis.  You promise to give people updates after you get your bearings.  You go to your office and sit back and close your eyes, trying not to be annoyed at the idea that you are now <em>behind</em> on your project, or what is meant by "we."</p>

<hr />

<p>I've been here, more times than I care to think about.  This is not a specific story in my life, but it is every heroic work story.  An emergency creates clarity by forcing exclusive focus on a single goal.  You can learn more about the way your systems work in one crisis than you might in a whole year.  And it's exhilirating beyond description to face down the stress of an impossible problem and come up with the answer.  But the hard truth is, working this way is a huge mistake.  You not only harm yourself,  but you have made the company and the the product, which you're willing to bleed for, worse.</p>

<p>Possibly you are that hero or you work at a company with one.  Maybe you want to do the heroic things.  It's exciting and you get to break all the rules.  And you seem to have a limitless supply of the confidence needed to relentlessly seek an answer.  But there's a reason you work with other people, and when heroic individual effort is always necessary to stave of disaster it's a symptom of a greater sickness in the company.</p>

<p>Sure it's great to watch superhero movies.  But you certainly don't want to live in Gotham City—that place is a real mess.  If you are that hero, the best thing you can do is learn how to disconnect the Batphone; it will not only improve your own life, but it's the only chance to save that company and really build something great.</p>

<p>This story will serve as the manifesto for Boldocity.  For fifteen years I have strived to become the tragic hero depicted in this story.  But recently I have started to understand that working this way is a mistake.  The articles I write in the coming weeks will work on illustrating why I've made these claims.  Hopefully as I am able to more fully explore the issue through writing I will learn and explain the right way to do heroic work.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Step up]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I saw a great sign at the Franklin Institute the other day.  It was in the Franklin Food Works, it said, "Please, Step up and help yourself."  (<a href="http://http://cl.ly/9rwc" title="STEP UP!">Here's a photo</a>) Some employee was clearly trying to overcome the confusing layout of the place.  But he did more than that, he offered a tremendous life lesson.</p>
<p>Waking up and going about your day should not be drudgery, it should represent the thing you want to do more days than not.  If you find that is not true then, what are you waiting for, figure out why.  There are tons of people out there who will help you learn and cultivate the things you want, then the crucial thing is to make a plan to get there.  And don't let anything stand in your way.  The only way things will change for you is if you change them.  So what I have to say in response to that sign. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6YXm4b3H5c">That's god damn right</a>!</p>
<p>This is all stuff that's been said thousands of times in much better ways than that sign, that movie clip I linked to or this blog post.  But I think it's helpful to have it pointed out in a variety of ways.  It can be surprisingly easy to go numb to things around you if you don't remember how wonderful it is to be alive.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Choices]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>When you're old and curmudgeonly like I am you become set in your ways.  It's hard to believe but some of these ways are wrong.  Your habits are a result of your old thinking and most importantly your old actions.  Since I know everything now, it's conceivable to me that a younger version of me may have made an error in thinking and ended up habitually doing something silly, <strong>without thinking</strong>, like screwing around with my iPhone at every single spare moment throughout the day.</p>
<p>See what I did there with the bold.</p>
<p>We do things, we make decisions and choices without even considering the options.  Our subconscious not only can provide us with important facts, like all the words to the <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Gilligan's_Island#Ending">closing song of Gilligan's Island</a>, it also will bring up complex thoughts like the results of thinking or provide a course of action.  Don't believe me?  Think of the last time you drove a car somewhere and had one of those realizations like, "Holy crap I'm driving a car and not paying attention to where I am or where I'm going!  How did I make it this far?"</p>
<p>Learning anything requires repetition, so does unlearning.  But before you start training yourself what you want to do, like Zippity the Zebra in <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2077075/">Man vs. Beast</a> you have to "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5QwYJoLUfE">realize it's a race.</a>"  The key there is to set yourself a standing order to notice when you do some physical thing . Go on, put that subconscious to work for you noticing you taking the phone out, or eating that 28th cookie.</p>
<p>Now you are at that crossroads, where you make the choice.  The thing you've done at up until this point over the last 87 times this choice came up, the thing you decided you wanted to change for some reason, will seem very compelling.  It may even seem crazy that you ever wanted to or could change.  Here is where you will need to have thought out the good reasons for why you will change, to overrule the habit and emotional response that is tied into taking that habitual action.  What you want to do here is put yourself in the right frame of mind to realize, that, yes there are actually other things you might want to do besides restock the floors in <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/tiny-tower/id422667065">Tiny Tower</a>.</p>
<p>The way I recently learned and am trying to do that is to have a nice little slogan, "WWID?"  This means, "What Would I Do? Where I, is me heroically taking into account my full hierarchy of values."  This is a pretty general mindset, depending on the particular habit I'm trying to change I may just focus in on that one for a few weeks and have a different slogan to recall in my time of need.</p>
<p>So in summary, I plan to take certain things I don't want to do anymore and notice when I'm doing them so I can wake myself up enough to know, "it's time to make a choice," and then put myself in a heroic frame of mind to make that choice.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sprint for Health Millstone]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>As I indicated in a prior post, <a href="/logical-disconnect-1/archives/2011/03/27/the-game-of-life">The game of life</a>, I planned to post updates to help my motivation.  I've learned that my projects go much better when I periodically look objectively at my results thus far and make a conscious decision how to proceed.</p>
<p>I had initially planned an update every 9 days since it just happened that I was 108 days out from my goal when I started and being a geek I couldn't help but see the evenly divided intervals.  But, alas, I have missed not only 99 days but also 90.  We now stand 86 days from my goal and this is my first update.</p>
<p>So from an eating perspective it's been easy, I've been able to avoid all but a very small taste of sweets and all but a very small amount of grains.</p>
<p>I think it was easy because before starting I made an effort to pay attention to how crappy I felt.  How I was tired and always lacking something trying to find it in sugary snacks or in caffeine laden beverages.</p>
<p>And—I think this was stronger motivatio<span style="font-size: 11px;">n—</span>I also made an effort to actually imagine two alternate futures.  One where I now took responsibility for my health and one where I continued to drift eating and acting based on whim or emotion.</p>
<p>The first was me in 20 years, strong and healthy working with my daughters on some sort of outdoor project, maybe helping them build a new garden or shed in one of their homes, but here I was a man of 55 (the same age as my father <a href="/logical-disconnect-1/archives/2003/05/02/rest-in-peace">when he died</a>) doing hard physical work with my shirt off and not inappropriately.  Feeling temporarily winded from a recent extreme exertion and resting for a moment, taking a deep breath and feeling the exhilaration of being alive and reshaping existence to my will and paying with my effort.  And I was just at that moment before I plunge back in and continue at a hard task that will still take another hour or so after which I will enjoy a restful afternoon with good food and surrounded by loved ones.</p>
<p>
The second I don't like to think about, but I do anyway.  It was me in 20 years.  I can't really picture myself like I can in the first vision, but I am able "…to guess by hints, to see everything through the greater intensity of implication."<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> And in this case I am looking out.  I see myself in the sterile hospital environment.  I am uncomfortable, I've just woken up and have been laying this way for a long time, a few hours, a few weeks? I am just so tired and sore I can barely muster the energy to move.  I finally notice that here again I am surrounded by loved ones.  But this time the looks on their faces are masks of tragedy.  In this imagining I really pictured my daughters as young adults, they were beautiful if they weren't so sad.  I wanted to tell Allison that nothing could be so tragic as to put such a look on her face, and she tried to smile for me when she saw me awake, but the pity there was worse.  And Ashley never one to attempt to hide her emotions wouldn't even smile and was barely able to look at me.  I reached out for them with a tremendous effort and saw the tubes snaking around my arms.  And my arms were thin, flabby and pale.  Then I saw Michelle and it the suffering she was obviously trying to hide from me was more than I could bear.
</p>
<p>I didn't bother to fill in details about what particular disease had put me in such a terrible condition.  But to concretize the threats to my future of living a lifestyle where I ignore what I've learned about nutrition has helped my motivation tremendously.</p>
<p>I've diverged a bit from my original intent of this article into that motivation that has made the choice on what to eat easy.  Now to sum up my update.  My two primary measures of the effectiveness of my health sprint are my weight and how I feel energy wise and general comfort level.</p>
<p>Over the past 18 days I've felt great.  I made a great effort to get plenty of sleep, and I can't remember being better rested.  My energy level has been excellent.  I seem to wake up ready to take on the day and keep a more or less constant energy level until the end of the day when I start to get tired and ready for bed.  My creativity level has been high, and my stress level has been low.  I take surprises and emergencies at work well and have been less defensive when criticized or when I perceived criticism.  Also I've been very productive at work and in my personal projects making great strides toward my goals.  Finally I feel stronger.  I've been doing <a href="/logical-disconnect-1/archives/2011/03/30/tomatoes-for-strength">pushups occasionally</a> at work and they've certainly gotten easier to do.</p>
<p>As far as the scale, well that is the millstone, and the challenge or opportunity.  I've only dropped about 2 pounds per the chart <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/online/hdo.html">software</a> I use.  In the past when I've done this I've dropped weight more rapidly.</p>
<p><img title="HackDiet.png" height="360" alt="HackDiet chart" width="480" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/500c727de4b0d820d6a42ad8/515f5893e4b0f7bed43ad1d5/515f59b8e4b0f7bed43ae714/1302604470000/HackDiet.png?format=original" border="0" /></p>
<p>Based on this I am going to tweak my approach in an attempt to speed things up a bit. My plan is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cut out dairy (I got a milk frother for my birthday and have been enjoying tea lattes so for now that will pause)</li>
<li>Go to the gym more often, I am going to target 1 trip every 3 days.</li>
</ol>
<p>Other than that it's no sugar, no grains as I stated at the outset.  I anticipate feeling great, stronger and being lighter.  I'll plan another update in a few days.</p>
<p>Maybe on 81 days to go.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Another change I've made recently to help with my overall health is to try using a scheduling infrastructure for my day. For about three weeks now I've been using the <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro Technique</a> to plan and track my activity throughout the day.  It's improving my productivity and also helping me lose weight.
This relates to my physical health in two ways, first if I spend my days full of anxiety about all the things I'm not doing I can never get physically well.  Second it makes me do push-ups.</p>
<p>That probably needs an explanation.  Pomodoro is a time-boxing technique that guides you to do 25 minutes of highly focused activity followed by a short 5 minute break.  In the <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/resources/ThePomodoroTechnique_v1-3.pdf">PDF</a> the author suggests it should be a real break from any thinking about work.  I found the transition from a hard thinking task to a state of mental relaxation to be very difficult to pull off, my mind–already warmed up to the topic–would wander back to the problem I was working on.  So I decided to do a set of push-ups to help me relax.</p>
<p>So far I've gotten better at pushups, squats, and sit-ups.  Oh, and I'm enjoying my productivity based primarily on the structure to my day.  It helps me concretize the idea that I can only do so many things in a day and helps me at the hard task of prioritizing my time.  It also helps me measure how long I take at certain tasks.  Since I chronically underestimate I welcome the opportunity to improve my judgement.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[I'll sleep when I'm dead]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>When sacrificing sleep to do important work or play I've often made the remark, "I'll have plenty of time to sleep when I'm dead."  But little did I realize that by not getting adequate sleep I was working to bring that day closer.</p>
<p>I was clued into this fact by the various <a href="http://modernpaleo.com/resources.html">Paleo resources</a> I've studied over the past few years particularly <a href="http://robbwolf.com/">Robb Wolf's</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0982565844/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=logicaldiscon-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0982565844">The Paleo Solution</a>.  So I started paying attention to how I functioned on various levels of sleep.  I learned that I was able to think, act and feel much better when I was well rested.  I remember thinking, "Does anyone else know about this? It is actually possible to walk around with nearly super-human ability simply by consistently getting a full night of sleep!"</p>
<p>Now in my defense, I not only attended college but also have two young children and have worked primarily at technology start-ups throughout my career.  So sleep was scarce in my life and somehow I just had to find a way to get things done.</p>
<p>But it's not super-human, it's regular-human to sleep when tired, wake up well rested and feel alert and energetic during your days.  A good sign of trouble is you need chemicals to wake up and function at all and at bedtime you can't figure out how to fall asleep.</p>
<p>So I failed to mention in my initial post on my plan to win at <a href="/logical-disconnect-1/archives/2011/03/27/the-game-of-life">the game of life</a> that one other thing that is going to help me meet my health goals is to get plenty of glorious sleep. You too should get plenty of sleep tonight, you deserve it!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I have decided once again–and this time I can see it being once and for all–to get myself to an amazingly healthy place.  To me that means being below 200 pounds for the first time since 11th grade.  It means some other things too, but that number is the most important one for me.  So that is the primary target, really 190 is the target when I say, I'm where I want to be.  But I want this thing to be doable, so I'm breaking it down and sticking to a rough plan.  The first part of the plan is a sprint to my vacation where I want to be 210 or less.
I'm currently 238.  On March 14th I was 244.  And the real start of all this was this past Monday.  I have 109 days from March 21st to achieve the goal of 210.  And here is how I intend to achieve that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Eat no sugar, eat no grains, which means a diet primarily made up of meat and vegetables.</li>
<li>Play hard.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's really all I have in mind.</p>
<p>I have two other parts of it, but they aren't primary they are just ways to keep the motivation level high when faced with a stressful day and some tasty sugary grass cake.</p>
<p>I plan to weigh in every day, as it's something that worked well for me when I starved myself on the Hacker's Diet.  It's motivational it ties my high level get healthy goal to a concrete I see every day.  The other part is I plan to write about my progress here.  At a minimum I will write every 9 - 10 days.  So there will be at least 12 posts up here about this.  Probably more at first because I have other stuff to talk about regarding changing habits.  And I'm planning to write more by writing 150 - 400 words at a pop.</p>
<p>Lot's more to explain including the book <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Changing for Good</span>, what I mean by play hard, and why do I think grains and sugar will mess me up.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Making Plans]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>For a while now I've been trying to do a lot of things and getting many accomplished, but really want some focus on less things that I make tangible progress on.  And so I am looking to set myself some constraints in order to actually get things where I want them to be.  A few vague plans I have are to ship a game this year.  Actually I'd like to ship two games, but I am still floundering in the beginning stages of understanding and putting together a basic 2D OpenGL game engine.  So my plan is to have a rough beta version of something that at least works by my birthday.  Then I can set a new goal for shipping it.  That should help give me some focus.</p>
<p>Also along that front I'm thinking I should blog consistently about the things I do and learn while working on the game so it forces me to really solidify my understanding.</p>
<p>I'd also like to really get my health to a better place.  On Saturday Allison's karate school, <a href="http://eastwestkarateandfitness.com/welcome/">East West Karate</a>, had a class for parents of new students to learn a few basics so we can experience some of what they are doing first hand.  It really made me miss my training.  Now I haven't been to the gym or done any serious workout in months so I've been sore now for two days.  But on top of that I've gotten the best nights of sleep that I've had in recent memory due to actually using my body a bit.</p>
<p>So I'm considering joining their adult classes.  As I've already earned a black belt, they would allow me to wear it to their school and help me have an accelerated version of their curriculum.  But I have mixed feelings about that.  I did work hard and earn it, but I am severely out of practice and wouldn't want to embarrass myself or the school who awarded me my black belt by showing up there next week.  Also I'd want to do it only if I really am sure I'm committed to it.  So I'm thinking I'll set myself a target of June to get myself into better shape through a concentrated training program at the gym, and probably 2 or 3 days a week run myself through some exercises trying to recall and practice some of the martial arts skill that I had earned through hard work and let slip away.</p>
<p>Also I have plans to attend a <a href="http://thinkingdirections.com/">Thinking Directions</a> pilot class in New York City on Saturday from noon — 3, and I'm also very excited about that.  I'll have to see if I know anyone in New York that wants to grab dinner before I catch the NJT back to Trenton.</p>
<p>BIG THINGS COMING YOUR WAY!  WATCH OUT!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[One Calendar to rule them all]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>MobileMe Calendar finally got me past the occasional frustration and issues on my calendar sync solution.  They did this by breaking my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine">Rube Goldbergian</a> solution completely and having me setup a much simpler system.
My prior solution was like this, Google calendar for my work domain was my main calendar.  But when I first got an iPhone there was no two way sync between Google calendar and the iPhone, but I could sync using MobileMe between my phone and my desktop.  So I got a piece of software called BusySync (which I later upgraded to BusyCal), this would sync the Google Calendar to my desktop iCal store which would then be synchronized via MobileMe to my phone.  And it mostly worked.  I had my calendar on the web, on my desktop and on my phone and could make changes in any of those 3 places.  Although sometimes it would do weird things and I had to keep BusyCal always running on my work computer to keep everything going.</p>
<p>Recently I unthinkingly upgraded MobileMe to the new Calendar.  Which of course broke all of that for various reasons.  And this turned out to be the best thing I could do, as now I have a much simpler solution that seems to accomplish the same goals and work more reliably.</p>
<p>Now my phone synchronizes with the Google calendar directly using ActiveSync.  And my desktop and laptop BusyCal synchronize with Google calendar directly but only need to be running when I need a calendar there.  So MobileMe solved my occasional calendar problems by becoming useless for me.  </p>
<p>At this point I'll have to evaluate if there is any point to keeping MobileMe at all or if I can simply use DropBox to keep the other things in sync that MobileMe does for me, and I certainly don't need another email account, or IM account and their iDisk solution is a joke compared to the ease of Dropbox.</p>
<p>Is there any other value to this service I'm missing?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[AC Sludge]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>With a renewed interest in blogging, I decided to try out <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a> and came across some Drafts I'd partially written but never published.  So I've reformatted this one a bit and you get it now.  This was originally started on July 1, 2010.
Over the summer I happened upon a small pool of water around my Air conditioner in the basement which immediately began an hours long investigation and repair and left me feeling a bit glad but annoyed.  </p>
<p>I was glad that I was able to identify the cause of the problem and repair it, in only a few hours.  But I was annoyed that my plans for the evening were shot, and I had an ugly and distorted sense that I'm never able to do the things I really want to do, but must always spend my time responding to emergencies that are my duty.  </p>
<p>I know this view is wrong, but over the prior 9 months or so I'd taken on so much more stuff than I ever had before that I had been wavering between resentment against the world at large and anxiety about not being able to achieve my goals.</p>
<p>I think this experience and my response was a big step on my recovery from <a href="/logical-disconnect-1/archives/2010/10/15/resolve">going crazy</a>.  I reminded myself that to accept those thoughts, about never achieving my goals, would bring about a self-fulfilling prophecy.  And I reminded myself to see how the choices I make even in response to the unexpected emergencies are serving the values I want to achieve and keep. </p>
<p>It was at this time that I also realized I'd gotten impatient.  And couldn't remember having that problem since I was a wee tyke when I'd get pissed struggling to untie my shoes.</p>
<p>I think by repeatedly reinforcing a view that I should be getting more done than I was, and actually more than was possible was causing me to have an always present sense of impatience and frustration with myself and others.</p>
<p>I had decided that fulfilling my ambitions should be easy and when I couldn't do it I'd damn the universe for being impossible and myself for not succeeding anyway.</p>
<p>In the end I had to challenge the bad premises by comparing them with reality, and clear out those thoughts that had been gumming up my life.</p>
<p>Oh and if your interested about the AC.  I took it apart cleaned a bunch of nasty sludge that had accumulated in the drip pan under the coil.  And then using an old wire as a snake, dislodged sludge from the upper part of the pipe.  Finally hooking up a shop vac to the end of the condensate line and sucked out anything that would come.  It worked fine the rest of the summer.  And if there is a next time.  First thing I'll do is hook up the shop vac.</p>
<p>So, Anyone have recommendations for companies to clean and service HVAC units annually?</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>The Voices That Matter iPhone Developers conference I went to two weekends ago was awesome, I already wrote <a href="/logical-disconnect-1/archives/2010/10/18/game-on">too much</a> about a couple of sessions on the second day.  But the other point that I really ended up getting out of it was a simple example thrown out by <a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/instructors/hillegass.shtml">Aaron Hillegas</a> during his keynote.  His big pitch was that everyone should move past independence to interdependence.  And really find ways to work together to make even better stuff.  At the time it struck me as stuff I'd heard forever, but he suggested do code reviews with each other.
And for some reason that simple example got me moving, I had already decided to work with <a href="http://software.ryangrier.com/">Ryan Grier</a> a friend, former co-worker and the only iPhone developer I know personally who has any apps in the store.  I am going to integrating my latest app, TargetDate (coming soon to the App Store), with his <a href="http://software.ryangrier.com/mycntdwn/">MyCntdwn</a> on the iPhone so we can share data.  So when I was nearly done, I just bundled up my software source and sent it over to him to look at or tear apart or whatever.</p>
<p>He gave me some great feedback.  And Just that little experience pushed me into going to the most recent, and really just their second, <a href="http://shipitsociety.com/">Ship It Society</a> meeting down at <a href="http://www.indyhall.org/">Indy Hall</a> in Philly.  I definitely plan to continue going to them and to go to the <a href="http://phillycocoa.org/">Philly Cocoaheads</a> meetings as well and try to do something I rarely do, annoy the crap out of everyone with tons of questions.</p>
<p>So, it seems like I actually do like people sometimes.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[John Galt League update]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>It's been two weeks since the last update.  I'm happy to report that the Rearden Steelers are 2 - 0 in that time bringing me to 7 - 0.  My wide receivers are carrying me having huge games, and typically I've been helped by my opponent not having a great week.  This past week my opponent The Washington Oppresors scored 97, but I went off with 114.  So it seems my team plays to the level of the competition.
So a whirlwind tour of the rest of the league:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Culver City Conmen</span></p>
<p>Ran into the Buzzsaw of the Rearden Steelers in week 6 and despite the despair of having played me still managed to get 43 points out of Darren McFadden the next week and a win.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sedalia Sea Monkeys</span></p>
<p>Diana has been on a tear! Two wins and I think most importantly defeated Paul's Geekpress Generals handily this past weekend.  I imagine that Chez Hsieh was a battleground and it's probably better for Paul that he lost.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">GeekPress Generals</span></p>
<p>Paul has somehow coaxed Greg Jennings into consistent play two weeks in a row, however he managed that he deserves to have won the championship.  Also if I failed to mention it, he lost an epic matchup to Diana.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Dr. Ego Spengler</span></p>
<p>Mike's team won in week 6, but more importantly he lost in week 7.  Leaving literally nothing on the bench he was crushed by Amy's Gentlemen, who was so confident in her ability to win she taunted her opponent by starting Arian Foster while on a bye and still scored 109 points!</p>
<p><strong>Portland Agents Of Fortune</strong></p>
<p>2 weeks, 2 wins, good team management nothing left on the bench and big scores.  I'm hoping this trend doesn't continue.</p>
<p><strong>KC Money Barons</strong></p>
<p>Got the big first win of the season.  I think Corey has aspirations of going 7 - 6 the hard way.  Considering I'll probably lose my next 6 we can finish the season tied!</p>
<p><strong>Washington Oppressors</strong></p>
<p>Dwayne Bowe showed up!</p>
<p><strong>Connecticut BNS Brawlers</strong></p>
<p>Too many Cincinnati players to win, even if they keep scoring points.  Marvin Lewis has suffered from this problem for years.</p>
<p><strong>Fairport Diehards</strong></p>
<p>Ugh, 79 points left on the bench this week, and a ton last week.  Sometimes fantasy is just like that.</p>
<p><strong>Philadelphia Freeloaders</strong></p>
<p>The last two weeks they've let their opponents score too many points.  Work on it!</p>
<p><strong>Virginia Gentlemen</strong></p>
<p>Amy can't lose a game when she scores over 100 points.  Unfortunately when she scores under 100 she tends to lose by 6 points or less.</p>
<p><strong>Next week</strong></p>
<p>I promise to write stuff going forward on some schedule.  And I suspect it may be somewhat useless but I'll enjoy it, and that's what counts.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I spent the whole past weekend at the Voices That Matter Developers Conference which was hosted in Philly, right in that new glass and steel high rise that is connected to 30th street station.
It was awesome.  I think the best part was a dream I've had for most of my life actually looks achievable to me instead of like the thing I'll always wish I'd be able to do.</p>
<p>When I was a youngster my father had a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80">Radio Shack TRS-80</a> and a cassette drive and somehow had acquired some games on cassette, he may have purchased them or dubbed them from someone in a club, I really have no idea I think I was somewhere between 8 - 10 years old.  I played some of the "You are in a dark cave …." style games.  I tried my hand at writing some in Basic.  They were simplistic and pretty boring, even to me, after I got over the initial thrill of having created them.</p>
<p>Soon after I was given a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64">C64</a> courtesy of my Uncle Jim.  And I had hundreds of video games on 5-1/4" floppy for it and it was then I started a seed that has been with me for all of my life.  I've always vaguely wanted to make games, but for some reason never took real steps to make any.</p>
<p>I mean I took some steps.  When I had the C64 I bought <a href="http://www.mts.net/~kbagnall/commodore/gamemaker/info.html">Gary Kitchen's GameMaker</a>, and went through some of the tutorials but never really committed to figuring it out.  I didn't do much on that front for years, I was quite busy growing up, playing football, reading and really pursuing all sorts of other interests like earning some engineering degrees.  But then after college at some point when a company I was working for wasn't very interesting I decided once again to "pursue" video game making as a hobby.  I bought a book on .NET game development—I wasn't going to fall into the trap of doing it in Linux my preferred environment at the time, I <em>knew</em> I couldn't make a living with that.  As I read a bunch of the book, I saw this huge expanse of uncharted territory opening up before me.  It looked hard.  I knew I had lots of other things that were important, and although I told myself this was important, I hadn't really decided that it was.  It was the sort of thing I could do later, like work out or learn to speak Spanish or learn how to play an instrument.  There was a vague floating abstraction in my mind of how it will be when I'm a "game programmer" sort of how people think about how it will be when they win the lottery.</p>
<p>I had that typical mindset of most people who fail at some goal or another.  I wanted buying the book or software to be the hard part.  I wanted the software or book to replace me as the driver on the way to my goal.</p>
<p>Now to cut myself a break, I was achieving other values the right way with me in the drivers seat, all this time.  But at some point I need to either let go of that floating ideal or decide what it really means, if I want it, and how and when I'll get there.</p>
<p>When I started developing for the iPhone I of course thought of games but didn't have any ideas, I looked at how to get that done a bit but I saw this huge undertaking ahead of me, most of it consisted of: understand OpenGL which although confident I could figure it out, was not motivating at all.  The cubes in all the examples don't inspire confidence, neither does the linear algebra that I've more or less forgotten at this point.  And even if I could figure out openGL, I had no idea on how to tie that knowledge into whatever else I didn't know about game programming.  It seemed like I stood on the edge of a vast unexplored wilderness and knowing that if I were committed I could plunge in and build a little industrial town along one of the rivers out there, but also looking at the fact that I given my current pursuits I could hope only to do maybe 8 hours a week on this dream and see that I'd never even have a vague idea what a game should look like (on the inside) for years.  So I plunged in on iPhone program with the idea for ReadingTree, which I never classified as a game, although I guess in some respects it is.  I knew what I wanted and I achieved it to some degree.  Which I thought was just awesome, and still do.  And I've been working on a few other apps in the mean time, having a great time.  But figuring that game programming was something I'd do later, I'd get rich with my other apps, and full time job and then have 5 unbroken years to learn how to do game programming and finally get down to it.</p>
<p>Well thanks primarily to <a href="http://twitter.com/mikedaley">Mike Daley</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/rodstrougo">Rod Strougo</a> my premise of requiring omniscience to become a game programmer has been shattered, as they have pulled aside the first layer of underbrush and shown me a general path toward the promised land of "Game Programming."  And in just a few hours this weekend I cultivated some idea of what game programming would actually be, and more importantly decided that I will be launching a game in the Apple app store for an iOS device near you.</p>
<p>During the first day I, somewhat reluctantly, purchased Mike Daley's book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321699424?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=logicaldiscon-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321699424">Learning iOS Game Programming</a>.  I didn't want to have another game programming book sitting around collecting dust, but I planned on attending the game programming sessions so figured maybe this was the lottery ticket I'd been waiting for.</p>
<p>Then on the second day in the morning Rod Strougo of <a href="http://prop.gr/">Prop Group, LLC</a> gave a <a href="http://cocos2dbook.com/conferences/presentation-code-for-conference/">great talk</a> on using <a href="http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/">cocos2d</a> to create games.  He made it seem very achievable and tied the concepts in his talk to a simple example game which he dissected throughout and demonstrated the effects of simple changes.  I left convinced I could do the things he demonstrated and actually package a cocos2d game.</p>
<p>Finally the last session of the day was by Mike Daley, of the blog <a href="http://www.71squared.com/">71Squared</a>, gave my favorite presentation of all time called Moving to 3D.  The idea was making an OpenGL ES 1.1 app on an iPhone from scratch, so he introduced quite a bit of basics.  He created an app (<a href="http://tinyurl.com/28jp4pm">source available</a>) which put you in the center of a 3D world where you were subject to bombardment by ships flying overhead, you could use the gyroscope in the iPhone 4 to move the phone and change where you were looking in the world.  And tap the screen to fire missiles at your attackers.  His talk was basically an introductory walk through the essentials of making that game, diving into the code, jumping back up into theory when necessary, but only covering the absolute essentials in a way that was accessible to someone who is mostly clueless when it comes to this stuff.</p>
<p>Things that made zero sense to me before were clear.  I obviously know very little more now about actually creating a game, but I had built a conceptual framework of what was essential to know and how to begin learning what I needed to move ahead.  I am now very excited to have purchased his book and was brainstorming game ideas with my wife over breakfast.</p>
<p>I am going to dive into getting my current app finished and into the store as quickly as possible so I can get started on my game.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Resolve]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>When I was studying <a title="Wings Martial Arts" href="http://www.wingsmartialarts.com/">Karate</a> my instructor said to punch someone in the solar plexus (which incidentally I've just learned is actually known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celiac_plexus">celiac plexus</a>) would test their will to fight.  As a trained fighter you may be confronted by someone who has chosen to attack you due to many superficial factors, and a good solid shot to the solar plexus may help them see the full context of the situation and choose a different course before any irreversible physical damage takes place.
I will now ramble a bit about the past year of my life, and will probably tie it all together at the end.</p>
<p>I recently went crazy, and then recovered.  Not to belittle the other crazies out there because I wasn't too crazy but I was very stressed out and unhealthy both physically and mentally but able to function fully although not enjoyably due to working through real emotional pain.  Which is to say I was in continual internal conflict due to bad premises.  The conflict had been building since the end of last summer, and reached unbearable levels sometime in April.  At which point, I'm proud to say, I not only took steps to recover but at some level I knew that my crazy was just a problem like any other that had to be understood and corrected.</p>
<p>For now I'll spare the details, although I have been itching to write a bit about them either publicly or privately just so I could have a more thorough reference manual to recovery if I ever make similar mistakes in the future and go crazy again.  But it really came down to:</p>
<p>1. Trying to identify the emotional distress.
2. Trying to identify the thoughts leading to the emotional distress.
3. Reality checking those thoughts.</p>
<p>And really it was a set  of contradictions that caused my pain.  I was giving myself orders that I knew to be impossible and holding myself accountable for not somehow doing it.  Coming to face this and to deal with it has made me think long and hard about this line from Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand, "All the secret evil you dread to face within you and all the pain you have ever endured, came from your own attempt to evade the fact that A is A."</p>
<p>The good news was I found that I had let some errors creep in and corrected myself, and in many cases when I consciously corrected those errors I experienced immediate relief.  And as I continued to be on the lookout for evidence supporting and integrating my new ideas I started to notice that things that bothered me before no longer did.</p>
<p>My primary mistakes had to do with personal expectations of what I should be doing and should be able to do.  So I cut myself a break, and decided to conform my expectations to what is actually possible in reality.</p>
<p>The final step was fully committing myself to working on my physical health.  I'm currently (since September 7) eating a Paleo diet as outlined in Robb Wolf's excellent book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0982565844?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=logicaldiscon-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0982565844">The Paleo Solution</a>, focusing on getting sleep and usually working out 2 - 3 days or so a week.  And this is going very well.  I feel good and have lost 17 pounds.</p>
<p>And just have to thank one person: really the best support I had through my crazy was from my wife Michelle.  She kept me sane while I was going crazy.  And has also been doing a great job cooking me good food even though I make everything harder because I think wheat is poison.</p>
<p>So what the hell does all that have to do with the initial paragraph and title? Well all of these changes and revelations happened while I was still busy living a life.  This is the idea that is characterized well, albeit malevolently, by a character on <a href="http://www.hbo.com/the-wire/index.html">The Wire</a>, Lester Freamon, "A life, Jimmy, you know what that is? It's the shit that happens while you're waiting for moments that never come."  So fixing the subconscious is like changing the tires on a moving car, or performing brain surgery on yourself.  It's hard to know exactly when everything is working right again without drawing some lines and putting it to the test.</p>
<p>So ultimately over the past 3 - 5 weeks I've been confronted by some of the same stressors that in April I would have chosen to freak out or go binge on McDonald's and Cokes and cookies.  Some of them were pretty significant stresses.</p>
<p>And looking at them now, the idea that I would freak out about them is laughable.  It is as if Professor Lupin had shown me these things are simply <a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Boggart">Boggarts</a> and I must simply properly perform the "<a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Riddikulus">Riddikulus</a>" charm to defeat them.</p>
<p>Thinking to how I would have reacted before is almost like watching a TV show, it's hard to even understand what I thought the problem was.</p>
<p>Sure some are things I'll choose to do or fix, I'll just put them on my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0142000280?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=logicaldiscon-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0142000280">list</a> to do or fix and decide when I want to do them.  The other things you ask? What other things?</p>
<p>So I'm glad to say I've withstood the test to my resolve, and find it funny that I'd ever taken those other ideas seriously.  To actually compare them to a punch to the solar plexus is actually wrong, a better comparison would be a wild haymaker thrown by a drunk that never had hope of hitting the mark.  So to quote Atlas Shrugged again to close my post, "Of course I am all right, Professor.  I had to be.  A is A."</p>

            <title><![CDATA[John Galt League Week 5 re-cap]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>A timely and per my wife's criticism a bit spiced up recap of the JGL action from week 5.
<strong>Philadelphia Freeloaders (3-2) 86, Virginia Gentlemen (2-3) 85</strong></p>
<p>In a matchup where Vince Young outscored Matt Schaub by 13 points and Mike Tolbert outscored Arian Foster by 5 points there is no other way for it to end except by being decided by 1 point.  The worst part for Amy, manager of the Gentlemen, is that if she had not started a Defense she would have won the match.  But I agree that the Rams looked to be a great start against the Lions.</p>
<p><strong>Fairport Diehards (3-2) 85, Sedalia Seamonkeys (2-3) 78</strong></p>
<p>And Diana's Seamonkeys get exactly what they want out of Ray Rice, finally, but when your second leading scorer is your Kicker it's hard to finish with the W.  And running into an on-again Chris Johnson and hated (by me) Cowboy QB who was racking up points playing from behind meant that Tom Stone's Diehards took the win.  Both teams can look at the high bench production and play that age old Fantasy football game of second guessing yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Connecticut BNS Brawlers (3-2) 77, GeekPress Generals (3-2) 58</strong></p>
<p>The Brawlers victory gives me the opportunity to talk about my favorite subject and that is me winning fantasy football games.  Because his victory and mine came in lockstep due to the huge day by Malcom Floyd which necessitated a huge day by my QB.  Paul's Generals who have been solid all season, had the typical fantasy week where almost nothing goes right which was capped by Aaron Rodgers going down with a concussion at the end of the game.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ego Spengler (4-1) 69, Washington Oppressors (1-4) 53</strong></p>
<p>The good Dr. Spengler led by Mike King has been the most consistent JGLer over the past two years.  But this is ridiculous to get a victory where the top scorer is TE Marcedes Lewis with 17 is illegal, and I plan to use my commissioner powers to correct this miscarriage of Justice.  However I will insist that John Britely's Oppressors still retain their loss as well due to the fact that he snagged LeSean McCoy on waivers on Sunday morning when I am the one who's supposed to have the best player on my favorite team.  Unfortunately for the Oppressors in the best possible week to defeat the Ego got nothing from their team.</p>
<p><strong>Portland Agents Of Fortune (2-3) 109, Culver City Conmen (2-3) 88</strong></p>
<p>In true fantasy football fashion the Conmen have a solid week from many of their starters even with 4 players on BYE, but still manage to run into a team that had an even a better week.  As Brian Reich's Agents managed to put together huge numbers despite starting my least favorite Manning.  Yes I must admit Cooper is my favorite Manning.</p>
<p><strong>Rearden Steelers (5-0) 99, KC Money Barons (0-5) 74</strong></p>
<p>I am considering changing both of my daughters names to Philip Rivers as his consistency this season is the main reason I am 5 - 0, also a timely Falcons pickup before last weeks games helped me quite a bit here.  All I can say to Corey and his Money Barons is the winner of the league last year had a losing record, so anything can happen.  Also to illustrate this I'm 1 - 4 in the fantasy league my brother runs.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[John Galt League Week 3 and 4 recaps]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Now working to finally catch up on my fantasy recaps I got through weeks 3 and 4 and am making a personal vow to get week 5 in early this week.
<strong>Week 3 recap</strong></p>
<p><strong>Virginia Gentlemen 116, Culver City Conmen 109</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>In week 3 the Conmen put up a solid 109 with good
performances from most of their players.  Only the
Patriots D (1) and Matt Forte (3) underperforming.
Unfortunately their opponent the Virginia Gentlemen had
great performances particularly 31 from Adrian Peterson
who ran all over the Lions.  Here the Conmen were handed
their first loss.  This was the Gentlemen's first win.</p>
<p><strong>Fairport Diehards 106, Connecticut BNS Brawlers 73</strong></p>
<p>A huge game by Anquan Boldin, and great performances by
Romo and Chris Johnson vaulted the Diehards to a win over
the Brawlers despite their Cedric Benson's big week and
Mike Wallace having a huge game down in Tampa.  The
Brawlers unfortunately left Peyton Hillis on the bench
for his huge game not having to share any carries with
Jerome Harrison and LeSean McCoy had his worst game of
the season so far.</p>
<p><strong>Sedalia Sea Monkeys 65, KC Money Barons 51</strong></p>
<p>The Money Barons continue to have a hard time
manufacturing points where Colston, Celek, DeAngelo
Williams and Steve Smith (Carolina) are all not producing
consistent with where they needed to be drafted.  Drew
Brees is the only bright spot this week as the Barons
fall to 0 - 3.  The Sea Monkeys get a huge game from
Dustin Keller and manage to scrape together enough points
to top the Barons bringing them to 1- 2.</p>
<p><strong>GeekPress Generals 114, Portland Agents Of Fortune 66</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong> The Generals put up big performances from Collie,
Mendenhall, Rogers and the Steelers Defense to post huge
numbers in week 3, which was more than enough to top the
Agents of Fortune who aside from Michael Vick and Steven
Jackson couldn't get anyone else in double digits.  The
pair of Calvin Johnson and Larry Fitz who strike fear in
the heart of fantasy opponents continue to frustrate.</p>
<p><strong>Washington Oppressors 75, Philadelphia Freeloaders 59</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The Oppressors had solid performances from Turner,
Charles, Bowe and Cutler riding the Chiefs 3 - 0 record
and overcoming a bad outing by their Bucs defense to
their first win of the season.  The Freeloaders who
grabbed the Chiefs defense and were rewarded by a good
game were hurt by their reliance on the Houston passing
game and Schaub, Walter and Andre Johnson that didn't
post big numbers this week.</p>
<p><strong>Rearden Steelers 105, Dr. Ego Spengler 92</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>In a high scoring matchup the Steelers got good performances from Rivers, Maclin, Bradshaw and their newly added Cardinals D, to offset strong performances from Peyton, LT and DeSean Jackson.  Luckily the Chiefs were able to hold Frank Gore down to 14 points and help the Steelers to their 3 - 0 record and hand Dr. Spengler his only loss.</p>
<p>Additionally the Steelers are 3 - 0 against doctors this season.</p>
<p><strong>Week 4</strong>
The First week of byes, which leads to all sorts of scarcity and fun in trying to decide who to start or pickup.</p>
<p><strong>GeekPress Generals (3 - 1) 87, Culver City Conmen (2 - 2) 79</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>In week 4 the Conmen had a solid performance from their
Defense but put up goose-eggs from the Moss tandem at WR
as Washington had success running on my Eagles and had no
reason to even look at Santana and Randy was on the outs
in New England.  Two zeros in a line up when playing a
consistently solid GeekPress Generals usual spells
disaster and this week it made the Conmen fall to 2 and 2.</p>
<p><strong>Philadelphia Freeloaders (2 - 2) 66, Fairport Diehards (2- 2) 57</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Oddly the second game of the week where a team posted nil
from the wide receivers, but in this case they managed to
win as the Freeloaders got solid performances from Mike
Tolbert, Matt Schaub and Zack Miller.  And the Diehards
were only able to get double-digit points from Flacco and
Ryan Matthews as Denver was able to hold Chris Johnson to
only 4 points</p>
<p><strong>Virginia Gentlemen (2 - 2) 106, Connecticut BNS Brawlers (2 - 2) 74</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>And you can tell it's a bye week as yet another team
manages to post a pair of zeroes, but even more
impressively the Gentlemen still manage to put out 106
points as they are the top scorer this week.  Helped by a
combined 56 points from Antonio Gates and Arian Foster
(who took 1 quarter off for missing a team meeting).  The
Brawlers who did have some solid performances from Carson
Palmer and Peyton Hillis but also had the misfortune of
running into the 2nd highest scoring team in the league.</p>
<p><strong>Sedalia Sea Monkeys (2 - 2) 90, Washington Oppressors (1 - 3) 46</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The Sea Monkeys continue to get good performances from
Dustin Keller and finally their other players posted some
solid numbers as well as they finally hit on a QB that
was going to give solid numbers as Sanchez put up 14 and
Reggie Wayne and Joseph Addai turned in good weeks.  The
Oppressors hurt by byes and missed updating their lineup
and started the out Pierre Thomas and Shiancoe on a bye
only managed 46 points and Jay Cutler was absolutely
manhandled by the Giants posting a -3.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ego Spengler (3 - 1) 76, KC Money Baroons (0 - 4) 70</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Spengler riding a huge game by LT against the Bills was
able to hang on for a 6 point victory over the Money
Barons who were hurt by an oddly ineffective Drew Brees
at home against the Panthers and Steve Smith who went out
with an injury.</p>
<p><strong>Rearden Steelers (4- 0) 92, Portland Agents Of Fortune (1 - 3) 63</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>MJD finally put up some big numbers to justify his pick
at #3 overall, and got consistently good numbers from
Philip Rivers and Roddy White putting together another
solid game to go to 4 - 0.  The Agents of Fortune got a
huge game from Calvin Johnson but Vick going out with an
injury held him to two points and Mike Sims-Walker
continues to disappoint with a 0 point week.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[John Galt League Week 2 Recap]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Due to working past 2 AM two times in the past week, really throwing off my sleeping schedule not to mention the impact such things have on my family life my recreation time was severely impacted.  But I managed to stay focused and put out a recap before week 3 got underway (barely).
<strong>Rearden Steelers 86 GeekPress Generals 84</strong></p>
<p>In the closest game of the week the Steelers got strong performances from Philip Rivers and Roddy White for the second straight week and are concerned about MJD who managed only 2 points and 12 for the season.  The Generals got solid performances from most players although the Rodgers to Jennings combo has yet to really pay off.  This came down to the Sunday night matchup between New York and Indianapolis, where both Dallas Clark and Austin Collie scored TDs for the Generals but it wasn't enough to overcome Ahmad Bradshaw's points helped by a Brandon Jacobs benching for an awful run followed by a temper tantrum where his helmet ended up in the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ego Spengler 90 Sedalia Sea Monkeys 64</strong></p>
<p>While the Sea Monkeys got many solid performances, they had no outstanding performances and are having a real problem at Quarterback with Kolb injured and now benched in favor of Vick and Garrard having a very rough game at San Diego.  The good Doctor Spengler got huge games from from Gore, Manning and DeSean Jackson which offset some lesser performances by the rest of his squad putting him over the top.</p>
<p><strong>Portland AgentsOfFortune 98 Virginia Gentlemen 92</strong></p>
<p>In a close matchup this week the Gentlemen had good numbers across the board hurt by poor QB play from the veteran Favre who is finally showing his age against an underrated Miami Defense.  Unfortunately the Gentlemen this week's third highest scorer had the misfortune to face the AgentsOfFortune who were this weeks second highest scorer.  Helped by my favorite team, the Eagles, who are apparently unable to tackle anyone when Stewart Bradley is off the field which gave Jahvid Best a huge 40 point week. Also cashing in on that Eagles v. Lions game Calvin Johnson finally scored a TD that counted helping the Agents to a big win.</p>
<p><strong>Philadelphia Freeloaders 106 KC Money Barons 42</strong></p>
<p>The Freeloaders rode Houston's massive game against the Redskin's where Matt Schaub and Andre Johnson combined for 50 points.  Also worthy of note is the Freeloaders had Kevin Walter on the Bench who also had a giant game and those three players combined would have been enough to beat 4 other starting lineups this week.  The Money Barons had the game that nightmare game that every fantasy owner can count on, where nothing goes right.  Totaling only 42 points for the week and going into Monday night (with 2 players left) had only 18 points.  They did have a few solid performances and I expect they'll turn it around going forward.</p>
<p><strong>Culver City Conmen 68 Fairport Diehards 54</strong></p>
<p>The Conmen improved to 2 - 0 on the season despite the tough game their patriots had in New York.  Putting together a handful of good performances and Darren McFadden trying to answer critics with a big game was enough to top the Diehards who had a tough week with nobody in the starting lineup finding the end zone and Chris Johnson being held in check by the Pittsburgh defense.</p>
<p><strong>Connecticut BNS Brawlers 83 Washington Oppressors 75</strong></p>
<p>The Brawlers are another team that cashed in on the Eagles-Lions game where LeSean McCoy went off racking up 30 points and making up for a handful of low scoring Bengals in his lineup.  The Oppressors fall to 0 - 2 despite some good performances from Jay Cutler, Dez Bryant and seeing Shiancoe and Pierre Thomas be real workhorses for their teams.</p>
<p><strong>Transactions</strong></p>
<p>The Steelers were frustrated by their 2 - 0 record on the waiver wire this week being unable to grab Tolbert or the Dolphins Defense due to the waiver priority enjoyed by other savvy owners who snagged these players.  A few teams worked the waiver wire to bolster their teams, I think the top one being Tolbert who looked solid in Ryan Matthew's absence and whoever owned Michael Turner last year will know the dreaded high-ankle sprain is not an exciting injury for a top RB on your team to have.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[John Galt League Week 1 Update]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I am the commissioner of the <a title="The John Galt League on ESPN" href="http://games.espn.go.com/ffl/leagueoffice?leagueId=715869">John Galt League</a>, a Fantasy Football league for Objectivists.  It's <a href="http://www.dianahsieh.com/">Diana Hsieh's</a> league and this is my second year as commissioner.   While it was enjoyable last year I did little more than remind people of deadlines and schedule the draft.  I decided to try and squeeze a little more value this year by writing up a review like this periodically thinking my increased involvement in the league would make it a bit more competitive and fun, hopefully for everyone.
<strong>Week 1 Recap</strong></p>
<p>My Steelers pulled out a 73 - 61 victory over Diana's Sea Monkeys while I was sleeping but Phillip Rivers was going strong, overcoming a solid WR showing by the Sea Monkeys but zeroes from the injured Wells and Kolb who left early held them back in the lowest scoring match of the week.</p>
<p>The reigning champs the Geekpress Generals managed to be the only team that broke three digits even with posting a zero from Darren Sproles as they defeated the Virginia Gentlemen 110 - 79, an inconsistent performance from the Gentlemen's starters and drawing a tough matchup put Arian Foster's monster week to waste.</p>
<p>Peyton Maning was playing from behind all day and was forced to throw which helped push Dr. Egon Spengler ahead of the Philly Freeloaders 77 -73 who despite a great performance from Miles Austin but had too few players find the end zone in week 1.</p>
<p>The Fairport Diehards benefited from the Jets CB Daryl Revis, first in having his defense post big numbers but in forcing Flacco to look away from Mason and find Anquan Boldin for a high scoring week netting him 87, the Agents Of Fortune couldn't keep up, as too many top guys didn't deliver and they only managed 69 points.</p>
<p>The BNS Brawlers and Money Barrons fought the tightest contest of the week each getting some solid performances but a low scoring opening NFL game meant Brees couldn't come up wtih the numbers to overcome Palmer's garbage time stats playing from behind after getting blown out by New England, the Brawlers won 78 - 76.</p>
<p>Finally the Culver City Conmen had some huge plays out of Matt Forte, and lots of points from his beloved Patriots which gave him more than enough to overcome the Washington Oppressors, who suffered the biggest injury of the week losing Ryan Grant for the season.  Despite some solid performances from Jay Cutler and Pierre Thomas the Conmen prevailed 93 - 72.</p>
<p><strong>Week 2 News and Preview</strong></p>
<p>Despite the fact that the commissioner forgot to send a waiver reminder a few teams put in claims, the Agents of Fortune snagged Vick for a favorable matchup and The Oppressors laid claim to Brandon Jackson the expected replacement for his lost Ryan Grant.  Next week get your waiver claims in Wednesday night because early AM (ET) ESPN will process claim requests based on priority order.</p>
<p>Most of the match-ups (based on current lineups as of 10:30 PM on Friday) are fairly even based on the ESPN projections except for the BNS Brawlers and The Oppressors where the 0-1 Oppressors are currently favored by a whopping 59 points.</p>
<p>So everyone get your lineups in, check your injuries and enjoy week two of the John Galt League.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Time Tracking]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Tired of ending my workdays wondering what the hell I'd done why I couldn't even manage to get one of the three things on list for the day completed I decided to take action.
Much of my career has been in tech startups, particularly companies providing various types of Internet services, so I've dealt with many customer complaints and done quite a bit of troubleshooting and repair.  So on any problem I would quickly push aside emotional evaluations or irrelevant details to get to and repair the root of the matter.  So when I finally recognized that some of my project completion issues were a problem like any other to be understood and solved by uncovering the relevant data.  I realized I just had to find a way to see exactly what I am doing, because I knew I was doing valuable work for my company, but just mostly not what I had intended at the outset of the day or week.</p>
<p>In my typical fashion I decided I would write a software tool that would be quick and easy to enter tasks, what job that task was related to and how long I'd spent on the task.  Then I realized I don't have time to do my job every day let alone write some other tool, and this seems like one of those tools that some smart web 2.0 style kids would have built ages ago.  So I Googled time tracking and came up with <a href="http://toggl.com/">toggl.com</a>.  It was everything I wanted, from very quick task entry, pie charts showing percentage of time on each project and for my purposes it was free, as I'm not trying to use it to bill clients.</p>
<p>I've been using it now consistently for 3 weeks.  I decided for "Project" I wouldn't try to track my time on projects in the GTD style, but rather against what David Allen calls your Area's of Responsibility, or in other words the big bullet points in your job description.  After 3 weeks I have 14 different "Projects" on the list and an able to see at a glance where I'm choosing to spend my time.  It has helped me emotionally in seeing that these things are necessary for accomplishing my job, and to be able to block out time for areas that need extra attention, and to know that means that other slices of the pie will suffer and I must account for that.  Also for giving me a sense of accomplishment at the end of the day and a way to sum up what I've done.</p>
<p>Also it's a great tool for driving conversations with my employer.  "Hey, I'm the only person in the company working on X, that means if you want me to do more of it or move it faster you'll need to help me obtain resources or reset expectations for W, Y and Z."</p>
<p>As far as using it, I've not spent more than 15 minutes in a day on it.  I've tried before to track my tasks but have always failed.  Knowing that I went in determined to record only essentials but get a complete picture of the day.  So I don't record every mundane task but will record something as small as 10 minutes if it's on a job that I think will add up over time.  So I'll typically record somewhere between 5 and 20 tasks on it in a day and be able to then get the perspective I need on my work to make longer range plans and decisions.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>A tweet or facebook status update was too short and unformatted to capture this and I had to write it immediately.
Michelle was singing to the girls after the most packed day at Disney. (started at Animal Kingdom around 9:30 and finally got back to the Pop Century resort at 10:50 after seeing Fantasmic).</p>
<p>Ashley stops Michelle singing saying, "Wait! You forgot to put Minnie in my song."</p>
<p>Michelle: "I put her in, I said Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Daisy and Pluto"</p>
<p>Ashley: "Oh! I thought you meant Pluto the planet."</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Listening to <a href="http://peikoff.com/">Leonard Peikoff's</a>  <a href="http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/peikoff.com/podcasts_web/83.mp3">podcast #83</a> I really enjoyed the closing of his answer to someone who wrote to him, essentially, I agree with many of the principles of Objectivism but disagree with Ayn Rand on two ideas (I think it was architecture as art and something to do with her view on women), am I still an Objectivist?
He said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So I hope you don't think of: this and this and this is required for [Objectivism] … I wouldn't even think about what's required for Objectivism.</p>
<p>Just think about "<strong>what's true?</strong>" And then if Objectivists don't believe it, it's tough on them.  You could say, Objectivism is good but it has this mistake.</p>
<p>You can't think, with the idea that the answers are in the back of the book given by Ayn Rand.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Goals not Rules]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Catching up on some of my reading I came across <a href="http://www.dianahsieh.com/blog/2009/09/steve-jobs-on-apple.shtml">an analysis of a Steve Jobs interview in Forbes</a>.  I agree with the analysis especially on Diana's last point.  To succeed you hire the best, the most resourceful people you can find and give them goals to accomplish.  You don't go hunting for those who you think will strictly obey your rules.
To clarify, my point is not to discourage the use of checklists or standard ways of handling requests.  Standard processes in handling repetitive tasks are very important not only when multiple members of a team are working together, but to avoid mistakes when doing infrequent or tedious work.  It's the way the exceptions to this checklist are handled that separates the followers from achievers.</p>
<p>Working in small startups most of my career has made the difference between these two types of employees stark and easy to spot.  One focuses on what they are supposed to do, the other wants to know what they are trying to accomplish.</p>
<p>If I understood the job well enough to write strict rules I'd just write software to do it, and not waste time recruiting or interviewing.  This is the error the big service companies make when they put a 300 layer voice recognition system between you and their customer service reps.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[MobileMe's apprentice]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I've been using <a href="http://www.apple.com/mobileme/">MobileMe</a> to keep some things, including calendar, in sync between my work's iMac, my macbook and my iPhone for over a year.  Generally I've been pleased, but after upgrading my phone to 3.1 and my iMac to Snow Leopard I've encountered a very irritating problem where my "accounts" in the calendar on my phone had duplicated and seemed to spawn multiple constant synchronization threads, to the detriment of my using the phone or having the battery not drain.
After screwing around with it today and finally getting some live chat help from the MobileMe support site I figured out how to clean it up and what is causing it.  First the cause is the subscribed calendars I have on my desktop iCal.  I have one calendar, but I subscribed to a handful of other calendars so I could quickly look at what a few other persons of interest were up to.  I've had it this way a long time, but it was just during the last few days I noticed I could see the subscribed calendars on my iPhone.  And then everything went wrong, and for every one subscribed calendar I had I ended up with a new calendar account.</p>
<p><img title="Many accounts" height="480" alt="Many accounts" width="320" class="size-full wp-image-1012" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/500c727de4b0d820d6a42ad8/515f5893e4b0f7bed43ad1d5/515f59b0e4b0f7bed43ae663/1254256603000/Many-accounts.jpg?format=original" /></p>
<p>The fix was found partially through reading this article the MobileMe support chat rep sent me, <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3677">iPhone/iPod touch: Resolving duplicates and removing all contacts/calendars/bookmarks with MobileMe or Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync</a>, and having the problem resurface once I had "fixed" it once.  </p>
<p>First turn off "Push" on my phone, then in iCal remove all subscribed calendars and sync it to MobileMe, this is only a minor annoyance for me as they are all google calendars and I can view them in that interface.  And then on the phone toggle the calendar sync setting for the 
MobileMe account from on to off selecting to "delete" the calendar data from the phone each time, until finally left with a single account.</p>
<p>If I knew an easy way to report this bug to Apple I would, but I wasted enough time on it now and don't want to go hunting for a way to tell them.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Quitting Doctors]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I recently had a shock when my children's pediatrician announced she was closing her office.  We love this doctor, she helped us through scary times and was always there with answers when we had medical questions or even seeking general advice about our children.
She is closing her practice for financial reasons and those who know the philosophy I follow may assume I am going to blame the government or ObamaCare for this.  Well I cannot, I don't have enough information to make that judgement in her circumstance.  But I do have two points I'd like to make.  </p>
<p>First if the government makes further incursions into healthcare as is proposed under ObamaCare which is currently embodied in the so called <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125310546537515699.html">Baucus plan</a> physicians will quit or close their practices, they've said so (I'll provide a link later).</p>
<p>Second, on a recent trip to get our daughters a flu vaccine, our pediatrician — upon first facing my wife since making her announcement to close her practice — asked her, "please don't yell at me."  My wife was shocked, we were of course both saddened to hear she was closing but we would never berate her for it.  I was appalled to learn that other parents thought they were right to yell and insult her for a decision that she made which was obviously painful for her.  I think the idea that makes people think they were right to yell at this woman is very closely related to the idea that makes them think they are right to force the doctors, insurance companies and ultimately their neighbors to provide healthcare under government coercion.  The idea is that the sick are entitled to some sort of medical treatment above all other considerations including who has to go broke or more importantly who has to be forced under threat of violence to provide it.</p>
<p>This all came to mind when I read Dr. Paul Hsieh's most recent, and quite excellent, op-ed published at Pajamas Media, titled <a href="http://pajamasmedia.com/blog/is-your-doctor-getting-ready-to-shrug/">Is Your Doctor getting ready to Quit?</a>  I recommend everybody read this as the proposed legislation will impact them.</p>
<p>If you are genuinely interested in the morality and practicality of so called Universal Healthcare — and not just partisan bickering or blatant lies — The Objective Standard has made several of Dr. Hsieh's other articles on the subject available to read online for free:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.theobjectivestandard.com/issues/2007-winter/moral-vs-universal-health-care.asp">Moral Health Care vs. "Universal Health Care"</a></li>

            <title><![CDATA[Strict Filtering]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I like to think about things.  I can spend hours trying to find the right way to solve any problem from serious to silly.  This is one of the reasons I'll let myself get caught up in an email black hole.  As I was this morning.  Responding to or dealing with the tasks inside each email like it's the only thing in the world to work on is extremely silly as it takes the email and any embedded tasks completely out of context.
So I am writing this to remind myself, that email isn't my job, it's a tool that is crucial in the small part of my job that has to do with communicating with others.  And to turn Strict Filtering back on in front of the tasks I choose to work on.  Also the strict separation between doing the tasks embedded in my inbox and the task that is processing my inbox.</p>
<p>It really shouldn’t take me more than 15 minutes to empty the email inbox.  I should rifle through each message spending about 30 seconds to read, decide if it's actionable, what I'm going to do about it and file the action reminder appropriately.  If it's an email that is longer than 30 seconds to ready, I can decide if I am ever going to read it and file the reminder to read it somewhere.</p>

One is the real deal, the league I've been in with my wife for what seems like 3 or so years every year, but undoubtedly it's been at least 7 years, the TMCFL run by <a href="http://tom.mcallister.ws/">my brother</a>, on a <a href="http://fanball.com/">site</a> that is getting increasingly crappy since being acquired by an NBC Sports affiliate.  </p>
<p>The other is the <a href="http://www.dianahsieh.com/blog/2009/08/john-galt-league.shtml">John Galt League</a>, where I am the acting commisioner, brought together by the common fact that we all are fans of Diana Hsieh's blog <a href="http://www.dianahsieh.com/blog/index.shtml">NoodleFood</a>.  </p>
<p>I also have played in <a href="http://ryangrier.com/">Ryan Grier's</a> league for the past few years where I tend to be terrible.  </p>
<p>And finally as always I picked up a Yahoo public league in order to practice drafting before the TMCFL, although given the awesomeness of the ESPN mock drafts I may stop that after this year.</p>
<p>I am currently fantasizing the fame, fortune and prestige of winning both the JGL and the TMCFL as I watched my Eagles whup an overmatched Panthers and noticed my top pick in both of those leagues, Adrian Peterson, racking up the points.  I am now convinced that he will score at least 3 touchdowns every week and I will dominate all of the competition.  </p>
<p>Stay tuned for too frequent updates of my fantasy prowess or complete silence if my team collapses into disarray.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[flagging acknowledged as harmful]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>If somehow you missed it, a few weeks ago the Whitehouse thought it would be a good idea to <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/facts-are-stubborn-things/">encourage citizens to report on other citizens</a> that were spreading "fishy" information about healthcare.  I promptly reported myself and asked to be added to the list of political enemies because Healthcare is a legitimate need of man, but to declare it as a right is to destroy all rights, see Ayn Rand's essay <a href="http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=arc_ayn_rand_man_rights">Man's Rights</a> for a detailed explanation.
That email address for reporting citizens has since <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0809/26188.html">been discontinued</a>.  While in the circles I travel I didn't hear anyone excuse this action by the Whitehouse, I have a fear that the majority of American citizens find nothing wrong with it or see it as something worthy of a passing chuckle at those who were outraged by this action.  I have nothing to say to the ones who would react in a laughing manner, meaning those that don't take ideas seriously, for the same reason I wouldn't try to teach a pig to sing.  For those that honestly wonder why such a thing is worth getting worked up about, I'd encourage you to think about <a href="http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=arc_ayn_rand_the_nature_of_government">The Nature of Government</a>, why it exists, and what effect such an entity would ultimately have on the spread of ideas while openly collecting a list of dissenters.  </p>
<p>Governments are properly formed to secure rights, not to provide goods & services, spread ideas or prevent the spread of ideas.  To see the dead-end on that road you need the ability to think in principles and only a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism">passing</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism">familiarity</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union">with</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Germany">history</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Environmental vulnerability]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>If you know me you know of my damnable addiction to demonstrable fact as opposed to consensus opinion, mystical revelation, emotion, or necessarily oversimplified computer model.  So you'll not be surprised that I find the shrill cries of doom from the environmentalist movement distasteful at best and life-threatening at their worst, that is once they start enrolling the government as the muscle enforcing their maniacal hatred of man.
So I was interested to see, a unique perspective on the analysis of energy and the environment, an article by Dr. Keith Lockitch called <a href="http://www.aynrand.org/site/DocServer/ee_climate_vulnerability_keith_lockitch.pdf?docID=2221">Climate Vulnerability and the Indispensible Value of Capitalism</a>, announced yesterday on the blog <a href="http://blog.aynrandcenter.org/the-real-threat-is-not-climate-change-but-green-climate-policies/">Voices for Reason</a>.</p>
<p>He addresses the ideas from an interesting angle, rather than wade into the muck about the science of climate change he focuses on what other factors make us susceptible to harm by storms or other climate disasters, in his words:</p>
<blockquote><p>Climate alarmists are trying to make people hysterical over the possibility of large-scale changes to the earth’s climate, which they claim will be a “planetary emergency.” But they ignore the fact that our susceptibility to climate-related threats depends on a lot more than what’s happening in the atmosphere. In particular, it depends on our political and economic conditions.</p></blockquote>
<p>He shows that policies which stifle innovation and protect wilderness, for wilderness sake, make us ill equipped to prevent or react to storms, fires and other disasters.  He also presents historical examples where industrialized countries fared much better in similar weather related disasters to countries that were pre-industrial or weighed down with statist controls.  </p>
<p>I recommend reading it because it strikes a blow against the assumption that the solution to bad weather is outlaw industrial society and return to a "simpler" time.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Overload and a Coke]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I have just made an important discovery about my mental limitations and my response to them.  I've confirmed something I had already known, that my mental stack for sub-tasks is finite.  For a while I've been troubled occasionally by a nearly overwhelming emotional need to do anything else besides my current work.  For a few months now I have been seeking, opportunistically, to understand this emotional state because it seemed completely at odds with my goals and my usual relentless need to understand things.
The idea here is there are often tasks that have hidden or unrealized requirements.  An example is you start out to vacuum the rug, and you need to clean up the clutter and move furniture, but when you move the furniture you discover that the leg on the chair is so loose that it is unsafe, so you go to repair it only to find that your out of wood glue and finishing nails.  And to make it to the hardware store you need to stop and get gas and go to the ATM for cash.  So when you originally set out to vacuum the rug you never would have said, okay well I'd better go get gas and some cash before I get started.  I've heard that this phenomenon is referred to as [yak shaving](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving).  But I think most people have experienced this, and typically the stacks of additional tasks don't get too deep.  However, in my work it is nearly a daily occurrence that my projects uncover things I could never have known until the work was begun.  Some block your progress and some don't, some are big, but some are small.  I've found it's the small ones that block your progress that were really stacking up on me and causing a problem.</p>
<p>If it is a big problem, meaning a full project in it's own right, and is not blocking my current progress, I simply make a note that this new thing needs to be done too and continue on my way.  Even if it blocks my progress, I'll go ahead and shelve the first task and take on the second one.  But if it is a small problem and blocking my progress, I just switch to this new task, and try to mentally retain all the context that got me there.  Generally this works, but, often my extra tasks go down so deep that I reach a point where it is impossible to retain the whole context.  This mental overload is real, and painful, and I've been dealing with it all wrong.</p>
<p>When I reach this point of mental overload I run away screaming!  Well not literally, but I certainly do try and do anything else.  Suddenly it seems like checking my email, or going to get a coke at the vending machine is the most important thing in the world. I think there are other factors in play as well, such as, if the driving project behind these sub-tasks is something that is only mildly interesting or something I loathe then the threshold for the number of sub-tasks I am willing to endure is much smaller.</p>
<p>The breakthrough in my thinking was realizing that this overwhelming need to go find and clean my white tennis shoes was in direct response to learning I had yet another task to be pushed onto the stack.  So the emotional response was because I was no longer able to hold the whole of my current task in my head, and I have now set up a contradiction.  </p>
<p>I know the thing I am doing is important and more important than the new thing because it is bigger and implies the new thing, so to prevent myself from losing the broader context I will not work on the new sub-task so I don't lose any of the important details of the super task.  But I also know that I cannot proceed on the broader task without working on the sub-task.  As this contradiction leaves me nothing to actually do I might as well get a coke and avoid the whole irresolvable mess.  </p>
<p>Now this has been a source of guilt and loss of productivity for me for a while because when in that mess I'm not making progress on my project.  But from [David Allen](http://davidco.com/) and [Jean Moroney](http://thinkingdirections.com/) I've already learned the solution to mental overload.  That is to write things down.  </p>
<p>So the strategy I've just developed is when I recognize this feeling to stop and ask myself, "Are you overloaded?"  If the answer is yes, then I simply need to write down the context I am in danger of losing.  At this time I suspect that will consist of a list of the outstanding tasks that are standing in my mind.  </p>
<p>If the answer to that question is not, yes, I have a backup question that has helped me with procrastination before that is, "What do you want?"  I mean this in a broad way, basically, it helps me bring to mind the reasons behind undertaking the tasks in the first place.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Upgrading software]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Apparently keeping your old software up to date is important, if you still use it and it is publicly accessible.
I noticed my brother's <a href="http://tom.mcallister.ws/away/">away site</a> had a huge spam problem, which I thought odd, since I had installed a spam filter a long time ago.  </p>
<p>I logged in and noticed the spam filter was missing in action.  It wasn't just disabled or working wrong, it was gone.  This combined with the fact that a few weeks back everyone who commented on the site was listed as "Anonymous" regardless of what information they entered finally clicked in that some script-kiddie nonsense was going on.</p>
<p>I saw that someone had managed to upload a handful of files into the /tmp directory I would guess compromising some well known flaw in WordPress version 1.5, and make an entry in the DB to activate their files as plugins.  It turns out the filter wasn't actually gone just hidden from me and disabled.</p>
<p>No matter I just kept his data, installed the newest version of WordPress and I've fixed both of those annoying problems.  Now I'll just have to remind myself to keep those sites up to date.  I also took the opportunity to disable a couple of sites that I know aren't really functioning anymore but may have had code accessible to the outside world.  So if you were counting on my test install of <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a> for anything, tough luck.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Becoming depressed by the increased destruction of individual rights by the government is quite easy these days.  The fact that the current administration is <a href="http://zerohedge.blogspot.com/2009/05/cliff-asness-i-am-ready-for-my.html">violating contract rights</a>, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/03/30/obama.autos/index.html">firing the CEO of a corporation</a>, and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/14/AR2009051401425.html">forcing banks to take bailout money</a> among many other examples of statism are all very ominous indeed.
To continue this trend, today, I received an email from <a href="http://casey.senate.gov/">Senator Casey</a> singing his own praises for his role in the further <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/A-New-Era-for-Credit-Cards/">meddling with the credit markets</a>.  </p>
<p>As is typical when I receive such self-glorying proclamations from my elected representatives I take a moment and compose a letter responding to them and encouraging them to uphold <a href="http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=arc_ayn_rand_man_rights">individual rights</a> as an absolute as is the necessary and only purpose of a <a href="http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=arc_ayn_rand_the_nature_of_government">rational and moral government</a>.</p>
<p>I began writing my response somewhat lethargically but when I organized my thoughts it brought to mind a particular passage from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Atlas-Shrugged-Centennial-Ed-HC/dp/0525948929/mclazarus-20/">Atlas Shrugged</a> which provided the fuel to complete task.  I decided then to look it up and to share it here.</p>
<blockquote><p>I could say to you that you do not serve the public good--that nobody's good can be achieved at the price of human sacrifices--that when you violate the rights of one man, you have violated the rights of all, and a public of rightless creatures is doomed to destruction.  I could say to you that you will and can achieve nothing but universal devastation--as any looter must, when he runs out of victims.  I could say it, but I won't.  It is not your particular policy that I challenge, but your moral premise.  If it were true that men could achieve their good by means of turning some men into sacrificial animals, and I were asked to immolate myself for the sake of creatures who wanted to survive at the price of my blood, if I were asked to serve the interests of society apart from, above and against my own--I would refuse, I would reject it as the most contemptible evil, I would fight it with every power I possess, I would fight the whole of mankind, if one minute were all I could last before I were murdered, I would fight in the full confidence of the justice of my battle and of a living being's right to exist.  Let there be no misunderstanding about me.  If it is now the belief of my fellow men, who call themselves the public, that their good requires victims, then I say: The public good be damned, I will have no part of it!</p></blockquote>
<p>Hank is the man!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ruining the Meal of Productivity with Snacks]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I've realized another perfectionist tendency that I've been letting defeat me.  The result has been that the big hard (and interesting) tasks are starving for attention because the little tasks are being given center stage of the always elusive and much coveted big block of time.
I've learned through my years of focusing on productivity with increasing responsibility that you aren't going to be able to sit and work on a problem for 10 hours straight without lots of other stuff just exploding.  The obvious solution to this is to break things up from 10 hour tasks into smaller chunks.  That way the chunks can be interleaved throughout your day, and you work in layers[^1].</p>
<p>The problem arrises is that some tasks can't be chunked up, they are hard, consequently they are the ones I enjoy the most.  Sitting down and really thinking about a hard problem to come up with a clean solution is one of the things I enjoy most.  But perversely I will resist starting the hard tasks.  </p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>The pain associated with being interrupted at such a task is real and is brutal.  So I resist because I am certain I will be interrupted and I am not completely certain that there isn't something else more important to do.  I have tons of snack-tasks[^2] that have piled up into a big-meal sized task.  These snacks are very important to me and each can and must be taken care of quickly and efficiently.  Often some need to be done before I can decide what big task I should work on.  The problem is, to continue the snack metaphor, I have ruined my productive appetite for a big meal with snacks.  The piled up snacks are now a big-meal task in their own right.  So instead of quickly clearing the inbox from 9:00 - 9:15.  I am doing a GTD style weekly review from 9:00 - 11:00.  This leaves me only an hour before lunch, when I know I don't have enough time to make a proper start on one of my big tasks.</p>
<p>So I've realized the real problem is not that my queue of bite-sized tasks has reached meal size, but that I have implicitly decided that I need to eat the whole meal.  I had properly queued the tasks when I was doing other things so as not to be distracted, but instead of just taking a few things or 15 minutes worth of things off the queue a few times a day.  I have decided that I must empty the queue now before continuing or I will (*horror*) have left the task incomplete.  This is the same problem as thinking you need to do the whole project in one sitting rather than just the next-action.  The allure is these little tasks are usually easy to do, and if I'm interrupted easy to resume later.</p>
<p>So I've decided the solution is to not empty the queue every time I process the inbox, or go to read flagged articles.  It's to use natural time limits, 4 minutes before a meeting, 10 minutes before lunch, 30 minutes before I need to take Allison to school, to get as many of them done as possible.  Or set an artificial time limit at the outset of my chunk of time, process the queue until the time limit expires and reserve my big blocks of uninterruptible time for the big, fun and ugly tasks.  </p>
<p>My hope is that by challenging the idea that I need to completely process every one of these queued up snack-tasks, I will be able to interrupt myself from them to realize I actually have an unbroken 2.5 hours ahead of me and I could stop snacking on almonds and dig in on a big juicy steak.</p>
<p>[^1]: The concept of working in layers is something I learned from Jean Moroney at [Thinking Directions](http://thinkingdirections.com/).  I highly recommend her course on Thinking Tactics and am anxiously awaiting her book.</p>
<p>[^2]: By snack-task, I mean things like clearing my inbox, updating financial information, reading some articles I've flagged as interesting, having a quick phone call with a vendor or anything that can be done completely in a short amount of time, say between 2 and 30 minutes.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>It's a shame that the great business producers continue to sanction completely irresponsible government.  Read this in Warren Buffet's annual report for Berkshire Hathaway, Inc.
"Whatever the downsides may be, strong and immediate action by government was essential last year if 
the financial system was to avoid a total breakdown."</p>
<p>Since we all know that sacrificing the strong to pay for the mistakes of the weak and then pretending there wasn't an underlying problem always fixes everything.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Knowledge or Grades]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I read a post at [NoodleFood](http://www.dianahsieh.com/blog/) this morning, [1 in 7 Americans functionally illiterate](http://www.dianahsieh.com/blog/2009/02/1-in-7-americans-functionally.shtml).  And it reminded me of how grades are treated versus knowledge.  The primary reason you go to school is to gain knowledge.  Grades are simply a tool used by the educators to assess your grasp of what they are teaching.  Contrary to their purpose the grades, degrees and diplomas seem to be seen by students as some magic stamp.  They are trying to achieve the reverse of cause and effect.  The students and parents want the effect which is the good grade and what that can mean for their life and careers, without enacting the cause which is learning the subject.
My brother teaches writing at Temple University and he'll occasionally share the excuses and pleading that he receives from students and astoundingly, from their parents.  He once had a students father ask him for a better grade, offering no valid reasons only the fact that she needed it.  I would never have been able to ask my parents to plead for charity from a teacher.  Had I tried my father would have given me hell and refused.</p>
<p>I always saw the line at the teacher after a grade was returned going to beg for points as an insane waste of time.  Getting good grades was easy.  I was there to learn, and they measured my knowledge of the subject matter to give me a grade.  It all worked out really well.  </p>
<p>The only time I remember going to the teacher after a test (not after it was graded) was when I found part of the test unfair.  The mid-term had a question worth 40% of the grade on the test.  The point tested by the question was covered, but only in two or three paragraphs out of many chapters in the reading.  It was never addressed in the lectures or homework problems.  I thought the proportion of the grade it represented was unjust.  The point was not essential to the overall understanding of the course, but could represent a whole letter grade overall.  </p>
<p>I went to explain my concern and was greeted with condescension and derision, possibly justified, as there was a group there to complain and, I assume, beg for a better grade a priori.  He told me, "I'm sorry you didn't do well on the exam but I will not change it."  I made an enemy for life when I told him, "I'm sure I got an A on the exam, I just thought the weight of that question was unfair."  He then confirmed my name.  I was not worried because I was not making an idle boast.  I got a 96/100.  He never liked me much after that which I had a hard time understanding.  As I clearly met his criteria and respectfully was raising a valid point.</p>
<p>I didn't like him much after that either, because I saw him as a small person trying to prove his superior knowledge by slipping unfair questions into a mid-term.  His superior knowledge was already acknowledged, why else would I listen to his lectures?  He of course was abusing the idea behind grades as well, using them as a false measure of self-worth.  </p>
<p>But although I judged him dishonest he was not overtly malicious and continued to give worthwhile lectures, which I continued to attend.  I was there to learn, not to achieve friendships with professors or even letter grades.  Those things were valuable, but secondary.  So the point is, remember your purpose in school or in sending your children to school.  </p>
<p>You send your children to school to learn, so help them learn.  Help them to understand cause and effect.  Don't cripple them by teaching them how to appeal to pity for better letter grades.  They'll just end up not understanding the words "former" and "latter" in a college classroom somewhere.  </p>
<p>And to reiterate what I took as Diana's point, if they are not able to learn because the school is not able to teach.  Hold the teachers accountable.  And attack everything that makes any incompetence on their part acceptable.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Ari Armstrong is planning a demonstration that it is possible to eat a healthy diet on a food stamp budget.  [Low-Carb Diet, Food Stamp Budget](http://www.freecolorado.com/2009/02/low-carb-diet-food-stamp-budget.html).  He is doing this not only to show that increases in the food stamp program are unnecessary, but in full protest of the entire program.
This not only protests the evil of redistribution of wealth, but will prove useful to those who think are honestly trying to eat a healthy diet on the smallest imaginable budget.  I look forward to tracking his choices closely as I could use some inexpensive ideas.</p>
<p>As a side note tomorrow will be a full month since I committed to greatly reducing refined carbs in my diet and I have lost 11 lbs.  This is with never finishing a mealy hungry and with my only extra exercise being a few lunch time walks, going to the gym one time and some snow shoveling.

  <p>Apparently my feed has been broken since Sometime in November.  At that time I upgraded wordpress, and possibly related was the merging of FeedBurner and Google.  Anyway It should be working now.  So for the 3 or 4 people who follow the feed, you will be delighted to know that I have been making an effort to add content regularly.  And strangely you have a little bit of catching up to do.  Unless you follow my tweets, then you probably already read all the posts.</p>

  <p>I've received word of a promising new blog focused on economics from an Objectivist point of view called [Simply Capitalism](http://www.simplycapitalism.com/2009/01/welcome-to-simply-capitalism.html).

            <title><![CDATA[Destruction and Praise]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Just a few quick opportunities to comment or send letters letting the newspapers know that even though they praise all the early work of the new administration, it still comes down to destruction of wealth regardless of their wishing or the fact that it was done by their favorite pragmatic politician versus the previous bunch of pragmatic politicians.
The newspapers seem to have an answer to the statement, "Bush had a stimulus and a bailout package and they aren't working."  Their answer is, sure he handed out money, but there was no oversight, no federal controls on the recipients of the money.  First this is false, there were controls.  Second, and most importantly, government controls and regulations and other meddling with the economy are the primary cause of this mess.  So their idea is that to make the economy work we must become more efficient at destroying wealth.</p>
<p>Here are a couple Inquirer and Daily News stories that are praising the destruction of wealth and productivity as good things:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.philly.com/dailynews/opinion/20090129_Will_billions_fix_what_ails_us_.html">Will billions fix what ails us?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.philly.com/inquirer/opinion/20090129_Editorial__Greenhouse_Gas_Emissions.html">Editorial: Greenhouse Gas Emissions</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We are setting up for a perfect storm.  Inflationary policies caused the dot-com bubble, the solution was of course to redouble the easy money policies to get out of the emergency which has caused the housing bubble.  The solution to this is now apparently to deal with the emergency by looting even more money to spread around and solve the problem.  Combine this with the arbitrary assertion of global warming, or climate change if you prefer, and the government will not only steal every dollar produced by our businesses but also make it illegal for them to produce because it is allegedly destroying the planet.</p>
<p>The answers are not hard to come by, just apparently hard to accept.  The government exists to protect individual rights, and that is it.  When it tries to cure any, let alone every, social and economic problem it necessarily violates some peoples rights in favor of others.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>The January 21st New York Times article, "[How Green is my Orange?](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/22/business/22pepsi.html?_r=2)"reveals the environmentalists most holy sacrament.  </p>
<p>The article shows giants of production, like [PepsiCo](http://www.pepsico.com/), are sacrificing their time and
ability calculating and reducing carbon emissions in an attempt to
avoid being a victim of governmental mandates.  </p>
<p>You may wonder at the
nature of the atrocity committed by PepsiCo that would require
governmental retribution and demands such atonement.  They are
cowering in fear because they have committed the only mortal sin
recognized by environmentalists, they produce life sustaining
nourishment for man.  While their efforts at reconciliation are to be
applauded, they are insufficient.  </p>
<p>The highest virtue and grace of
environmentalism can only be achieved by the complete sacrifice of man
and his values to the pure untouched wilds of nature.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Listening to a story about the SEC persecuting Apple because Steve Jobs is in poor health on the [WSJ](http://wsj.com/) daily read,  They compared it to a situation with HP where a director resigned.  According to the article, "Under securities laws a company needs to disclose the reasons if a director leaves over a disagreement about company policy."
Is the persecution of a company about a sick CEO or for the specific reasons behind a high level persons resignation an example of the "atmosphere of deregulation and deference to industry" I've been hearing so much about?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Eating to sustain life]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>After seeing lots of information from [smart people](http://www.dianahsieh.com/blog/index.shtml).  I decided to challenge some nutritional ideas I had implicitly accepted.  One major step on that road was reading [Good Calories, Bad Calories](http://www.amazon.com/Good-Calories-Bad-Controversial-Science/dp/1400033462/mclazarus-20/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1232129587&sr=1-1) by Gary Taubes.  He does an excellent job exploring the evidence and reasons behind the idea that saturated fat leads to heart disease.  He also puts forth a compelling argument against the use of refined carbohydrates in the diet.
Based on my research I have decided to refine my eating habits and have decided the following general rules.</p>
<p> * When in doubt eat meat (*BACON!*) and vegetables, protein and fat are good.
 * Make a special effort to eat high quality food. [^1]
 * Avoid Refined carbs (sugar, grain, tastycakes, Pez, ColdStone)
 * Avoid most vegetable oils (olive oil is good stuff)
 * Mostly avoid artificial sweeteners (I had been consuming quite a bit daily)</p>
<p>These "rules" came out of research and out of experimentation that started in late September of 2008.  The first observation that came from avoiding refined carbs was to avoid the energy roller coaster.  Although this term doesn't quite capture the feeling I had.  I had never felt like I have had too much energy, the extremes I felt were enough energy to survive, and I can't keep my head up.  After a few painful days at the outset where I dealt with headaches and a general feeling of disorientation, I have noticed a good general level of energy all of the time.  I have run many experiments and spent time finding foods I enjoy, and seeing the effect on my mood, energy level, and stomach.  This was the time I came up with those rules.  And then I decided to apply them rigorously in 2009 starting on the 5th.</p>
<p>The most noteworthy result is in that time I have lost 6 lbs, have been to the gym once, and have eaten as much as I wanted.  This can't be overstated.  I am experienced at [weightloss](http://mcallister.ws/weightloss.html) and I have never lost any without feeling hungry and dissatisfied at the end of most of my meals, having frequent headaches and suffering through frequent boring repetitive workouts.  </p>
<p>I have noted a few other immediate benefits as well.  I have discovered a whole host of foods I really enjoy.  I have saved some money by packing my lunch more frequently than usual.  I have surprisingly and quickly reached a point where I don't have the emotional desire to eat sugary foods.  And best of all, I feel good, and I can see that I will start to feel even better when I get my workout integrated into my routine.</p>
<p>[^1]: I'll give links and explanation of what high quality food is, in a future post.  For now you can satisfy yourself with the idea that it is less processed, less chemically treated.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Parenting and Thinking]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I've recently enjoyed reading a few posts and resulting comment conversation on parenting methods using positive discipline techniques.  [Discipline Update](http://principledparent.blogspot.com/2009/01/discipline-update.html), [On Positive Discipline](http://rationaljenn.blogspot.com/2009/01/on-positive-discipline.html), and [Positive Discipline and Rational Self Interest](http://rationaljenn.blogspot.com/2009/01/positive-discipline-and-rational-self.html).
One of the most useful thoughts in there is the recommendation to, "assume positive intent."  Meaning that the child is not being difficult as an act of malice, they are trying to fulfill some need of their own.  </p>
<p>The other idea I really clung to is, "obedience is not a virtue."  I like to look at parenting as training my replacement.  They start out small and helpless, and parents need to do everything for them.  But the goal from the outset is for them to grow into full independent people capable of selecting and achieving their own values.  This is part of the reason I am a maniac on the answering of "Why?"</p>
<p>The other new tool I have been experimenting with for months now is "Thinking on Paper" as presented by [Jean Moroney](http://thinkingdirections.com/).  I'd recommend it to anyone who needs to accomplish vague goals in any aspect of their life, or in David Allen's words, people who need to "make it up and make it happen."  The benefits explained <a href="http://thinkingdirections.com/TOPtest.htm">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
"Thinking on Paper" is a general purpose thinking tactic you can use to help you:</p>
<ul>
<li>concentrate</li>
<li>hold in mind the wider context</li>
<li>guide thinking purposefully toward the goal</li>
<li>quickly return to a train of thought after an interruption</li>
<li>stay calm and in control, even when the subject seems overwhelming</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I've found it particularly useful as a quick tool to deal with interruptions.  When working and a co-worker comes in, with full marching band in tow, to trample your thought process.  I ask them to wait one minute, I dump my state to paper or an [editor](http://aquamacs.org/).  Typically this is writing 2 or 3 **full** sentences about what I am thinking or what **exactly** I was planning to do next.</p>
<p>Now I can give my full attention to the new problem of herding everyone out of my office as quickly and efficiently as possible.  When I return to my work, I can regain my prior mental state by simply reading the sentences I had written.  It beats groping blindly, for all the scattered threads of thought, by a mile.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Tonight I had a discussion on voting with Allison.  She asked me what it meant.  I explained, "It's like when mommy asks you if you want cereal or toast for breakfast, and when you pick one that is voting for it."  She said, "Or pancakes?"  I said, "sure, or picking pancakes over the other choices."
I then added the democratic majority wrinkle.  I explained, "If 10 people were asked to vote, and you said you wanted pancakes, but the other 9 wanted toast, then you would all have to have toast."  She said, "I wouldn't like that."  I said, "Sometimes I don't like it either."</p>
<p>Michelle had talked with her earlier about voting and told her about my decision to not vote for any of the Presidential candidates.  So she said, "Mommy said you didn't vote for one."  I told her, "If you had to vote for food, and you had to pick tomatoes or sausage (two things she doesn't like) which would you pick?"  She said, "I wouldn't vote for either."  And neither did I.</p>
<p>In other news the barbie lamp won in a historic vote, defeating fish by a narrow margin of one vote and "play games on iPhone" defeated "go to sleep now" by a similarly narrow margin.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[A government of Laws]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>&quot;A government of laws, and not of men.&quot; -John Adams</p>
<p>This statement rang out loud and clear to me when I saw the <a href="http://extent-of-regulation.dhwritings.com/">Extent of Federal Regulation</a> made concrete, <a href="http://extent-of-regulation.dhwritings.com/">here</a>.</p>
<p>What John Adam&#39;s statement makes clear is the essential fact in a proper government that the law must be knowable and objective not subject to arbitrary whims of arbitrary men.</p>
<p>This does not mean 25 feet thick of books of regulations, and 6 feet of laws.  When both are being added to at a <a href="http://cei.org/articles/%E2%80%98hidden-tax%E2%80%99-rules-hits-economy">rate of thousands of new laws and regulations per year</a>, you have a situation where it is not possible to know in a single lifetime what is <em>permissible</em> action in a <em>free</em> society. I do not advocate anarchy, rather objective law.  It is impossible to have objective law when every action could require months or years of research to determine if it is punishable by the state.  This of course is only the Federal regulations.  Every state and town has their own collections of law books.</p></p>
<p>The solution, stop and repeal.  The obvious starting point for repeal is any and all regulations that handcuff industry.  And stop all of the regulation mills.  There are many government agencies that issue <em>Rules</em>.  Congress has delegated it&#39;s law making responsibility to faceless, nameless, and unaccountable bureaucrats.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[2008 Election Essentials]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>[Dr. Leonard Peikoff](http://peikoff.com/), friend and intellectual heir to Ayn Rand, publishes a podcast approximately every other week.  Despite the fact that he generally refuses to talk publicly about narrow political questions, he took some time in [his October 20 podcast](http://peikoff.clublogic.org/podcast/getaudio.php?filename=2008-10-20.033.mp3) to discuss the current batch of candidates.  He managed in a few sentences to say the obvious about each of the candidates in a way that would be funny if one of these gangs wouldn't be the head of the Executive branch of the United States of America on [January 20th](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration_Day).
> I think McCain comes across as a tired moron.  Obama as a lying phony.  Biden as an enjoyably hilarious windbag.  And Sarah Palin as an opportunist struggling to learn how to become a moron a phony and a windbag.</p>
<p>He gave some additional brief commentary as to why none of the Presidential candidates is fit to take office.  If you think there is still some reason to choose one over the other but aren't sure which you may want to listen, it could give starting points for further investigation.  </p>
<p>I decided some time ago that [I will not vote for any presidential candidate](http://twitter.com/mclazarus/status/943152811).  It was with that decision in mind that Dr. Peikoff's statement takes on a tragic humor and does cause me a brief chuckle.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Network Neutrality]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I came across a blog post, by [David P. Reed](http://www.reed.com/dpr/) regarding the recent [FCC order on Comcast](http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-08-183A1.doc).  His post, [FCC Order on Comcast - a good job](http://www.reed.com/blog-dpr/?p=12), the order and [his formal response to the FCC](http://www.reed.com/blog-dpr/?page_id=10) are offensive to the concept of private property.
His blog entry solicits comments, so I submitted one quoted as follows:</p>
<p>> “The Internet is a world-wide system that does not belong to any one operator, whether providing access lines or backbone transport.”</p>
<p>> And without the individual operators, who built, operate and own their parts of the network where would your world-wide system be?</p>
<p>> Taking away the use and disposal benefits while retaining the pretense of private ownership is socialistic, immoral and wrong.</p>
<p>> And if the moralistic view is to abstract, then consider, who will bother to innovate and create the networks of the future when eventually some mob is going to claim their collective non-contractual “rights” over this innovation. Especially now that we are all officially on notice that, “the Commission is watching, that it understands that the Internet involves a new set of technical challenges, and that the Commission is willing to act in a way that reinforces the success of the Internet as a whole.”</p>
<p>> Or in other words, some bureaucrats have decided what the Internet is today, it shall be forever, and they are willing to use force to sacrifice any individual who gets out of line to the collective.</p>
<p>It is currently being held for moderation.  I of course agree with his right to control the content of his site.  I will not be harmed if he holds it for moderation indefinitely or rejects it.  I can have no expectation to exert control on his property.  But I thought this a nice object lesson.  </p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Following to the logical end of the Network Neutrality debate, Dr. Reed, should have allowed my comment immediately even if he finds it offensive.  And this is because my expectations of blogs that solicit comments is that they have no rights with which to deny my ideas, even if it means broadcasting ideas that are distasteful to their "operators[^1] ."</p>
<p>The only and final word in the Network Neutrality debate is that the networks that Comcast and others have built are theirs and theirs alone.  They should not only have the responsibility of ownership and ownership in name.  They should have the right to use and dispose of that property as they see fit.  </p>
<p>Would it be unfortunate if they decided to block emails with the word 'the' in them and try and hold Google ransom?  Yes.  Undoubtedly.  What is to guard us against this terrible thing, certainly not their benevolence.</p>
<p>What should guard us against this is a free market that allows competition to spring up to fill a need.  If Comcast thought it could squeeze $300/mo for broadband but really could run a profitable business at $50/mo then as long as there is no stifling legislation[^2] in the way a competitor is born the next minute after Comcast announces their price increase.</p>
<p>And what if this Capitalist utopia doesn't happen?  What if no competition springs up, and no one can ever get to Google.com from Comcast forever and ever?  What if the internet becomes completely fractured and you have to pay tolls for everything?</p>
<p>My answer: a resounding too bad.  There is no right to internet service at all, let alone internet service of your choosing.   There can be no right to any good or service that must be produced by someone else.  If I have a right to a service, then who is the slave that must provide it?  Once you embrace artificial rights, you destroy the real McCoy.</p>
<p>[^1]: Notice how even the terms used in the neutrality debate deny property rights.  They are not the owners but the operators, the managers of a public trust, the caretakers of *our* property.  Yuck!  As someone who knows what effort it takes to build and run a network it makes me sick that those who could not or will not try to dictate terms on the producers.
[^2]: The problem **is** government interference at all.  Not which form is right.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Columbus Day]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>A day late, but here is my thought on yesterday's holiday.
Ninety men in three small ships sailed west from Europe for over a month, when dawn came on October 12, 1492, the sun rose on a new world.  Columbus, the motive power behind this expedition, was a man of independent mind that challenged the authority of the "experts" and of the whole world. He discovered America, bringing European civilization to our shores.  A critical and historic event that sowed the seeds of what was to become the freest and most prosperous country ever, the United States of America.</p>
<p>When thinking of yesterday, I remember the greatness, the courage, the independent judgment of a man.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Familiar sentiment]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>"The time is past when the notion of economic self-seeking and unrestricted use of profits made can be allowed to dominate….  The economic system must serve the nation."
This could have been written in any editorial recently, and certainly a similar sentiment was spouted on Capitol Hill in the past weeks.  But it is a quote of the Nazi Minister of Economics in the book [The Omnious Parallels](http://www.amazon.com/Ominous-Parallels-Leonard-Peikoff/dp/0452011175/mclazarus-20/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1223927521&sr=8-1).</p>
<p>With the economic controls and the sacrifice of individual rights to the nation, we are putting a motor on our drift from freedom to fascism.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Today I forgot to eat breakfast and got moving very late because I was immersed in what I was doing.  Spending so much time being interrupted and allowing myself to be interrupted I had started to forget the pure and simple joy of focused, productive work.  I intended to try and achieve that state as often as possible.  I need to blow off a few meeting reminders, phone calls and the like.  It's good for the soul.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Inevitable Result]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>The MSM had plenty to say about a 600 point drop in the Dow two Fridays ago when the house rejected the initial bailout plan.  The blamed congress for not violating individual property rights and granting a large scale bailout of wall street to try and prop up a failing economy.  Lucky for us they were able to paint the picture as simplistic that the federal government had an button under glass in the Capitol building which said in case of economic emergency break glass.  So the congress got to work, they broke the glass.  Now as I write the market is down significantly and is bouncing, but I suspect this is just a harbinger of greater plummets.  The Fed of course will print more money and lower interest rates, but this will serve to drive inflation even faster.
The problem is not the wrong intervention or even not intervening quickly enough, the problem is government intervention in the economy at all. Government is the agency of force.  Economic prosperity requires freedom, freedom to act on ones own judgment for ones own interest.  The only role for the government in the economy is rooting out and prosecuting fraud and other uses of force.  It is not a coincidence that the nation that was founded on individual rights and freedom is the most prosperous ever.  It is government intervention that caused this problem and that will continue it.  If the Congress wanted to act quickly they should have been discussing how to repeal laws which are applying friction to business, not make the biggest power grab for the central economic planners since the Great Depression.</p>
<p>The politicians have been blaming the "greedy" capitalists.  But those capitalists that are so greedy, are the ones that create wealth and jobs.</p>
<p>The long term outlook of government intervention in the economy is clear and clearly terrible.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Writing to government representatives]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>It is clear from the results and the form letters I receive from my Congressmen, for spending time writing well reasoned arguments, is not worth the effort.  I have therefore decided to change my tactics.  While I know at best my letters will be tallied into No support or Yes support piles by bored staffers, and at worst ignored completely, I can only hope to amuse myself through the time spent writing such letters.
As such I couldn't stop myself when I received a form letter from Senator Robert Casey in response to my many pleas to vote 'No' on this bailout plan in which he rationalized his position.  I decided the only tactic that would prevent me from becoming homicidal was to introduce sarcasm.  As such my letter follows:</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<hr>
Senator Casey,</p>
<p>Thank you for your words on the bailout, I mean stabilization bill.  I do agree with your sentiment, "I'm angry about the climate of deregulation and deference to Wall Street over the last eight years that got us into this mess."  If only the congress actually understood what deregulation means, but instead of actually deregulating the economy they have been adding new regulations nearly weekly.  Hopefully through this unprecedented power grab and the inevitable resulting economic destruction to follow, in terms of years, people will finally learn that even the first sliver of government involvement in the economy puts us on the road to economic destruction.</p>
<p>Oh, wait, upon re-reading your letter you seem to think that you are actually doing the right thing here and are actually solving problems not just making them extremely worse.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I thought you and I were in on a joke together, oh well, maybe the next Senator will understand individual rights and economics.</p>
<p>Well I can say one good thing about the "stabilization."  9 Trillion[^1] is such an odd number, so boring.  But 10 Trillion, well now, that is excellent.  A number you can really sink your teeth into.  And you almost entirely triggered the change with the passage of one bill.  Tremendous.  Maybe with all the other entitlement bills that passed this year we'll even hit 11 Trillion that is great, and prime!  Nothing is better than prime.  If Keynes were alive I am sure he would send you a thank you note and maybe even a box of chocolates.  Must stabilize the economy by continuing to spend, heck, throw in some flowers too.  </p>
<p>I for one will do my part.  I plan to apply for several more mortgages and loans.  It'll be a great win for the economy.  The builders will get paid, and all the people who sell to the builders will also get paid.  There is no discrimination, I can get my loans even if I am considered high risk, so no one can cry "UNFAIR LENDING PRACTICIES."  There is no bank failure, they aren't allowed to fail, you said so yourself.  And there is no way I can lose my "property."  I mean really we can't have banks going around seizing property, that is something that is best left to the federal government.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>
<hr>
Anyway, I feel much better now.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[EPA preparing to control everything]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>The EPA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR), on July 11, 2008, [Regulating Greenhouse Gas Emissions under the Clean Air Act](http://epa.gov/climatechange/anpr.html).
Ordinarily this would be of passing interest to me.  But their own analysis shows that they will have to have control of **Everything** in order to handle this mandate, from Page 5 of the ANPR:
> EPA’s analyses leading up to this ANPR have increasingly raised questions of such importance that the scope of the agency’s task has continued to expand.  For instance, it has become clear that if EPA were to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles under the Clean Air Act, then regulation of smaller stationary sources that also emit GHGs – such as apartment buildings, large homes, schools, and hospitals – could also be triggered.  One point is clear:  **the potential regulation of greenhouse gases under any portion of the Clean Air Act could result in an unprecedented expansion of EPA authority that would have a profound effect on virtually every sector of the economy and touch every household in the land**. </p>
<p>This doesn't only include reaching into your home and setting your thermostat for you, or deciding how many cars you can own or what type of home or business you can build, it also extends to the food supply as commented by the USDA on page 67 of the ANPR:</p>
<p>> … many of the emissions are the result of natural biological processes that are as old as agriculture itself.  For instance, technology does not currently exist to prevent the methane produced by enteric fermentation associated with the digestive processes in cows and the cultivation of rice crops; the nitrous oxide produced from the tillage of soils used to grow crops; and the carbon dioxide produced 
by soil and animal agricultural respiratory processes.  **The only means of controlling such emissions would be through limiting production, which would result in decreased food supply and radical changes in human diets**.</p>
<p>This amount of control will effect you, this is not just an additional tax on the rich, or other such nonsense.  These are real proposals that will limit your ability to live your life.  The idea that carbon dioxide is a pollutant is factually wrong.  As a matter of fact high concentrations of CO2 are required for plant life, our food supply, to flourish.  Bureaucratic control of where you set your thermostat, or if you are allotted enough energy to take two hot showers a day, or what types of food you can purchase is absolutely antithetical to freedom and the life of humans who depend on their reason and judgment to survive.  </p>
<p>The EPA is now accepting feedback on this until November 11th.  Now is the opportunity to make your voice heard.</p>
<p>There is information on how to submit on the EPA site, or distilled along with example letters and arguments [here](http://www.classicalideals.com/EPA_Ruination.htm).</p>

*[ANPR]: Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking

            <title><![CDATA[The government as Robin Hood]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Yesterday during a discussion about the proposed tax policies of the presidential candidates, someone stated to me that the richest people pay the least taxes because it's not income, they are able to hide it from the fed so they get away with not paying their fair share.  I provisionally agreed that the tax system is broken.  What follows is yet another verbose way of saying, "Get the hell out of my way!"
Those who come just to look at pictures of my family and not my political commentary, feel free to move along.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>So not even digging into real numbers but just a thought experiment.  Say there are 1000 people who make $100,000 for every 1 person who makes $1,000,000 a year.  Just for dead simple math.  If they were all taxed 10% that would be: $100,000 from the rich guy, and $1,000,000 from the non-rich group.  This is total tax revenue of $1,100,000 and the rich guy accounted for only 9% of it.  Looking at the number that way it seems small, the "working class" paid 91% of the tax burden.  Of course individually they each accounted for only 0.09% versus the rich guy who paid as much as 100 of them combined.  The real story is exceedingly more complicated than this, but the thought experiment is telling.</p>
<p>Also as a further and the only real argument against increasing taxes on rich.  It is a penalty on the good for being the good.  In order to be rich, you need to be very good at something.  I have often heard there is some percentage of people who achieved wealth through fraud, theft or other less savory means.  But I argue if they exist, they are the rare exception. To be a thief and get rich you have much more working against you.  So if you are very good at something, does that mean you should be rewarded or punished?  Of course rewarded.  Should you have your reward taken by force because someone else "needs" your money.  As wealth is created, it makes no sense to fairly distribute it as if it were an unowned natural resource.  There can be no right to goods or services that need to be created by others.  This includes wealth.</p>
<p>The rich guy had to use their mind to get rich.  Without him there is no money to steal.  I have to use my mind, my skill, my effort to design a communication system.  If you "need" a communication system, does that give you the right to send armed thugs to my house and threaten me with imprisonment to force me to build it for you?</p>
<p>As a final interesting twist in my thought on this, I came across an article in the Wall Street Journal: [Taxes are about fairness](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121910117767951201.html) that addresses my point exactly and even brings up the question, that was posed to Senator Obama, and his answer.  (which came up in my discussion mentioned above.)
> ... even after ABC's Charlie Gibson noted that the record shows increased taxes on capital gains -- which would affect 100 million Americans -- would likely lead to a decrease in government revenues: "Well, Charlie, what I've said is that I would look at raising the capital gains tax for purposes of fairness."
> 
> Translated into ordinary English, what that means is that it doesn't really matter whether a tax increase actually brings in more revenue. It's not about robbing from the rich to give to the poor. Robbing from the rich will do, especially if it's done in the name of fairness.</p>
<p>Reason is man's means of survival.  To see this, open your eyes, look around.  You can't miss it.  Government exists to protect each individuals survival, their use of reason, through protecting rights to life, liberty, property and the pursuit of happiness.  Infringing on the rights of one man for the benefit of another is always wrong.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I defy you to explain to me the difference between [ Barack Obama's sentiment](http://www.demconvention.com/barack-obama/), "We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country."  And the one uttered by Kang in [Treehouse of Horror VII](http://www.snpp.com/episodes/4F02.html), "Abortions for some, miniature American flags for others."
American politics is not even trying to hide the fact that their words are absolutely meaningless and they are just trying to unlock the right combination to get elected.  Playing a high stakes crossword puzzle.</p>
<p>By the way, please don't interpret this as support for the Republicans.  Their allegiance with the [ Religious Right](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_right) is an outright attack on the first amendment and until they renounce this partnership I cannot even consider supporting their candidates.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Intellectual Activism and Cultural Change]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Ideas are important.  Ideas shape culture and life.  I had recently decided to improve my life I would work, in <a href="http://www.olist.com/oactivists/">some</a> <a href="http://www.seculargovernment.us/">fashion</a>, to spread <a href="http://aynrand.org/">good ideas</a>.  So over the past month, along with diligent philosophical study, I have been trying to promote good ideas when possible.
I have submitted two LTEs, one to <a href="http://usatoday.com/">USA Today</a> and one to the <a href="http://philly.com/">Philadelphia Inquirer</a>.  They were both rejected but there was a brief moment of excitement when an editor at USA Today emailed me to confirm some information and tell me my letter was being considered for publication.  I plan to continue trying to get LTEs published, but in the mean time I have posted a handful of comments on philly.com.</p>
<p>I have also worked to improve my business life.  I have been classified as a "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pusher">pusher</a>" by some for my efforts to promote David Allen's GTD.  But I am having some impact, three of my coworkers have purchased <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280/mclazarus-20">Getting Things Done</a>, and to the extent any of his advice is incorporated into their daily routine it will benefit me greatly.</p>
<p>There is a need for good ideas in our culture.  It is this intellectual vacuum that allows bad ideas to become so prevalent so quickly.  So my advice is to know reality as well as possible and then be vocal in your judgment of the works and ideas of man.  "<a href="http://www.aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/moraljudgment.html">Judge, and prepare to be judged.</a>"</p>

            <title><![CDATA[When no politicians agree with you]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I happened across something written by [Gus Van Horn](http://gusvanhorn.blogspot.com/).  And it helped me to finally conceptualize a problem I had long been struggling to grasp about politics, voting and political support.
### Problem ###
There is limited political choice and each of the candidates has a platform of values they claim to uphold.  People will select a candidate by finding the one that defends at least one value that they hold [^1] or at least do not actively work against.  Upon making this selection they then join the fan club and defend[^2] or attempt to ignore all of the bad points to the candidate.  I will try and make this clear with the following example.</p>
<p>A person believes in the 2nd amendment right to own a gun.  When it comes time to vote they look myopically at their most important concrete value, the right to gun ownership.  They then not only vote for the person or party that is for protecting this right, but speak out in favor of them, defend or ignore their wrong ideas,  and drop any contradictions.  They actively, and often rightly, attack the other parties candidate all the while ignoring the flaws in their own choice.  They latch on to their candidate and argue with others with the zealous devotion an Eagles fan describing all the failings of the Cowboys or Giants to one of their faithful.</p>
<p><!--more-->
This is the thinking behind those political tests which decide where you are on some political chart and then tell you who to vote for.  Of course they try and make it slightly more complex not limiting it to one issue but 5 or 15[^3].  But using these tests are like trying to decide your morality with a calculator[^4].</p>
<p>> Murder = -100, Being Honest = +1, Self sacrifice = +5, so if I want to kill 2 people I'll have to be honest most of the time and give money to charities.[^5]</p>
<p>### Cause ###
The cause of the problem was fairly obvious once grasped.  It is the assumption that first you need to choose which of these two gangs you are with.  And then if you do have some reason to pick one over the other that you should then support that candidate.  It was this article ["Indeed" Indeed](http://gusvanhorn.blogspot.com/2008/01/indeed-indeed.html) that made this clear to me.  The idea is that when you join a group to support them you have now made your ideas, especially those contrary to the group, a non-factor.  Your vote is already counted.  And on the other side of that coin if you start your own party you are also a non-factor, your vote is already discounted, therefore so are your ideas.</p>
<p>The parties goals are to get elected and to meet that end they will throw out principles for pragmatism.  This is evident by the fact that both the Democrats and Republicans are basically indistinguishable at this point.  They are all scrabbling for the same votes and are therefore pandering to the same groups.  The more success the Republicans have going after the religious vote, and sacrificing the first amendment in the process, the more the Democrats will do the same.  And there are numerous other examples where, for all their differences, they are all basically the same.  Therefore the people with the power to change ideas are the people who have not blindly committed their vote for one or two baubles, tradition, or other irrational factor. </p>
<p>### So What? ###
This is not to advocate catering to pragmatists to get bread and circuses.  This is rather a call to moral judgments.  It is wrong to give sanction to the evils of one party just for one or two principles that haven't been wiped out yet.</p>
<p>To further the goals of individual rights you must remain uncommitted to the groups acting to destroy those rights.  You must then act to spread these ideas.  The only way to fight bad ideas is with good ideas and the way to support good ideas is to show everyone.  Man must live through means of reason, he must learn what it is he needs to survive and then act to obtain it.  The only way to have a society of man that promotes life is to promote reason and the way to do that is to bar the initiation of force from social relationships.</p>
<p>> The only proper purpose of a government is to protect man’s rights, which means: to protect him from physical violence. A proper government is only a policeman, acting as an agent of man’s self-defense, and, as such, may resort to force only against those who start the use of force. The only proper functions of a government are: the police, to protect you from criminals; the army, to protect you from foreign invaders; and the courts, to protect your property and contracts from breach or fraud by others, to settle disputes by rational rules, according to objective law. 
--[Ayn Rand](http://www.aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/government.html)</p>
<p>So I remain an independent, free to use my mind to chose my values and my government.  I will, most likely, vote for someone, but in the time when I am not pushing that button I will devote time to advocating good ideas.</p>
<p>[^1]: Or belongs to a party that had at one point defended this value.  
[^2]: I originally wrote "defend to the death" and removed for readability of the sentence, but put it down here because it is very apt in this context.
[^3]: Gus Van Horn has a nice [comment on these tests](http://gusvanhorn.blogspot.com/2008/01/quick-roundup-290.html#ibe) too, that helped me figure reach this post.  
[^4]: This of course is how many people actually do it.  And probably how the Iraqi war is to be decided.
[^5]: Of course even in this contrived example you could leave the murder part out and just rank self sacrifice as a positive virtue and watch the corpses pile up.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[A heroic journey]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>This is about my oldest daughter's first trip to the movies.  When she was born we had decided, based on what a friend of mine had done with his son, that we wanted to wait to take her to a movie theater.  Aside from the obvious insanity of taking an infant or a very young toddler to a place where they are expected to stay still and quiet for 90 minutes or more, I wanted the experience to be something that was memorable, special, something that we could look back on together with fondness.
We chose to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0910970/">WALL•E</a>, the Pixar movie, about a robot and what happens when he develops a consciousness, chooses a goal, and goes after it.  What follows is my analysis of the movie and of my attempt to write this review.  I will probably include spoilers of all sorts, so if you don't want to know any of the plot then move along.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>When I first watched a trailer the setting struck me as terrible.  I saw a barren earth populated only by one robot and trash and thought, "Okay so the environmentalist movement has taken over Pixar, and it is an agitprop film that is anti-man."  I had trouble reconciling this view with all of my other experience with Pixar, so based on their reputation of excellence I looked into it a little more.  I found I was still annoyed by the background, but the WALL•E character and the excellent animation and sound effects that showed through in a handful of trailers, along with the fact that the negative points seemed to be secondary and not part of the main plot I decided to go ahead and check it out.</p>
<p>Allison was very excited leading up to July 6th, when we chose to go see it.  We watched the trailers a few times to hype it up a bit and she couldn't wait to go see this big screen.  I think she also really liked the idea of going out with both Mommy and Daddy and leaving her younger sister with Mom-mom.  Once we got there she was very interested in the theater experience including the lighted walkways, the seat and especially the popcorn.  Once the popcorn was finished the film held her attention pretty well despite the fact that the storyline was a bit complex for a 3 and 1/2 year old.  She stood at the rail for about 40 minutes during the show, and only had her interest waver slightly.  We have talked about the film a few times since going and I have been able to clarify the whys and whatfors of specific points for her (1).  I was satisfied with the wait and the choice we made of when to take her.</p>
<p>As for me, once I got a glimpse of "Buy N Large" and saw the were to *blame* for the wreckage of Earth, I was very annoyed.  And then I got a look at the big fat humans that were too stupid and lazy to take care of their bodies but were able to create space cities which can transport thousands of people in ultimate comfort.  They can create robots that are very sophisticated and can carry out complex tasks but can't figure out how to dispose of waste properly or grow a plant.  I was more than annoyed.  However, I was able to just block out these parts that I disagreed with as I intended to go author a scathing review which exposed Pixar for the irrational capitalism haters that they were.  As I was enjoying watching a film with Allison I tried to enjoy the story as well.</p>
<p>I found the plot compelling the characters likable and excellently done.  I liked the story despite the obvious background flaws.  I left it feeling very annoyed at the contradictions in the film.  On one hand man can create wonders and can rise up and act heroically, but on the other hand they were unable to walk or not cover every square foot of the planet with 5 feet deep of trash.</p>
<p>So in trying to find the essential flaw in the film, the main root of the insanity, I kept running into the fact that I liked it and it had many good points.  I couldn't reconcile the flaws with the strengths.  It wasn't until I happened across a <a href="http://literatrix.blogspot.com/2008/06/wall-e.html">review by Jennifer Snow</a> that she pointed out my problem.  I was trying to judge the work by non-essentials, by the background, by the fact that it was set in a man made trash heap.   </p>
<p>Upon understanding this I relived the experience in my head and saw all the heroic acts by WALL•E as he identified his goals and gave everything he could to achieve them.  I saw the other robots that gained consciousness and worked and fought to gain their values, and the parallel to the humans on the ship that gained consciousness when WALL•E crossed their paths and woke them up.  I saw the contrast of the actions by the "broken" reject robots compared to the mindless dogmatic robots like the autopilot.  I saw the stylistic way the robots were made more real with visual detail than the cartoonish humans by the artists.  I saw how the background and how it got that way wasn't the focus, but just where the action happened to take place.</p>
<p>It was after this realization it was possible to write down my thoughts.  There was no overt contradiction, I just needed to check my premises.  I went there looking for flaws and I sure found them.  But if my focus is on flaws then what good can I find or offer?  While I would have preferred a different back story, the heroic journey by WALL•E and all of the people and other robots in the movie is well done and is definitely worth seeing. </p>
<p>1. Why? and What for? are just about my favorite questions that my kids ask.  It certainly can be tedious at times and I will often challenge them to come up with their own reasons behind things.  But I think the asking of these questions might be the most important developmental milestone for a child.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The reason for being]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>This site has languished because there was absolutely no purpose or reason for it.  I have spent some time and decided a few reasons for continuing it, and have thus renewed my interest in maintaining and updating it.  The below reasons are published here and on the site's <a href="/colophon">colophon</a> for newcomers to understand the purpose.
<!--more--></p>
<p>Previously Logical Disconnect served as a diary of rants and various diatribes of no particular purpose and with no cohesive theme.  Often it had, as most blogs, come off as complaints and sometimes information that was too personal to be of much use to anyone even those who know me.  Primarily it was a personal outlet for unformed notions I wanted to share but with no one in particular.  </p>
<p>In some sense the personal nature will continue, however, I have <a href="/logical-disconnect-1/archives/2008/06/26/coming-soon">recently</a> decided to use the writing here as a means to further my study of <a href="http://www.aynrand.org/">Objectivism</a>.  </p>
<p>My plan is to use it to write in order to learn.  It became explicit to me when listening to <a href="http://www.peikoff.com/">Dr. Leonard Peikoff's</a> lecture series <a href="http://www.aynrandbookstore2.com/prodinfo.asp?number=LP01M">The Philosophy of Education</a> that writing is a tremendously valuable cognitive tool.  It forces you to slow down your thought process and make well reasoned arguments.  If you don't want the concrete, the writing, to be utter nonsense then you must understand and mentally organize the subject.  And by doing this it requires you to integrate the concepts, you wish to write about, into your own hierarchy of knowledge.  To really understand the ideas in order to convey them.  This is to be part of my defense against any kind of dogmatism or other irrationality in my study of philosophy.</p>
<p>This is analogous to the "trick" I used in college to give focus to study.  When it became generally well known that I was doing well, I was often asked for help by other students in my classes.  By agreeing to help others I was required to understand the material well enough to convey it to them.  And if you have ever tried to teach, especially someone who is honestly seeking to learn, you can't fake this understanding.  After spending time teaching the concepts to others, my understanding of the material was unshakable.  This activity greatly focused my effort and diminished my need for additional independent study.  </p>
<p>By making the writing public I could be subject to criticism or counterarguments which may help me refine my ideas.  It will provide additional context to those I have been having frequent philosophic discussions with recently.  And will also further my wife's growing understanding that she has chosen a very unique individual to share life with.</p>
<p>I also plan to use the writing here as a tool for introspection and as a secondary value I would like my children to be able to have this as a concrete reference for knowing about their Father.  I know reading a copy of a single letter I discovered, which my father wrote years ago at work[1] gave me a different and unexpected perspective and even greater admiration for him.  </p>
<p>Yes this is a very selfish motive and personal collection of articles.  I intend to derive great value from writing them.</p>
<p>1. Yes letter, not email.  I said years ago. </p>

  <p>I am planning on resurrecting this site and posting regularly.  I have recently been made explicitly aware of the cognitive benefits of writing.  So in writing down my thoughts, especially if I intend to stand behind them and have them represent who I am, I am forced to clarify and organize the process behind my thinking.
I have decided that this practice will primarily help me to integrate new ideas.  Secondary benefits include improving my ability to communicate and will allow me to have more interesting interactions because it could be based on information I have already thought through.</p>

  <p>If you want a thing bad enough To go out and fight for it, Work day and night for it, Give up your time and your peace and your sleep for it
If only desire of it Makes you quite mad enough Never to tire of it, Makes you hold all other things tawdry and cheap for it</p>
<p>If life seems all empty and useless without it And all that you scheme and you dream is about it,</p>
<p>If gladly you'll sweat for it, Fret for it, Plan for it, Lose all your terror of God or man for it,</p>
<p>If you'll simply go after that thing that you want. With all your capacity, Strength and sagacity, Faith, hope and confidence, stern pertinacity,</p>
<p>If neither cold poverty, famished and gaunt, Nor sickness nor pain Of body or brain Can turn you away from the thing that you want,</p>
<p>If dogged and grim you besiege and beset it, You'll get it!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I am trying to get a list of some of the things people wish they had learned earlier than they did.  Like a life lesson, or something that life experience showed you that once you knew, you said, "Why don't they teach this in school?"  I would have acted differently had I understood this.
It is anything from small things to large life changing things.  I am trying to come up with things to make sure I expose my children to, so they have a chance to learn it early in life.</p>
<p>Obviously some things only come from experience and making enough of the same mistakes, but get the experience early enough it may click in faster.</p>
<p>An example of a broad topic here that I wish I had understood sooner, is money, investing and compound interest.  How about you?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Cover Letter]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Warning this is just a rant, but it does contain a useful piece of advice.&nbsp; If you are looking for a Job, especially if you have absolutely no experience.&nbsp; Don't just spam your résumé at companies.&nbsp; Try writing a cover letter for the job, and even tailor your résumé appropriately.&nbsp; Is this&nbsp;extra work?&nbsp; Yes, of course it is.&nbsp; But I have a question for you, do you want the job?</p>
<p>I knew this sounded familiar, apparently, <a href="/logical-disconnect-1/archives/2005/02/04/resume-mountain-reduction">I wrote about it before</a>.&nbsp; Last time I was trying to hire someone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So even though I stole my own thunder, here is the bottom line.&nbsp; If you are going to get a job, a human is going to read your application.&nbsp;&nbsp;Treat the hiring person as a human.&nbsp;&nbsp;Reach out to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ask them a question.&nbsp; Sure, you need a résumé that meets all the keyword search tests, or whatever way some numb nuts HR person is going to use to sort through them all, but, read the job description.&nbsp; Think about the job.&nbsp; Think about the person who is going to make
the decision.&nbsp; Write that person a letter explaining what you find interesting about the job posting.&nbsp; Be honest.</p>
<p>I would be more likely to&nbsp;look twice at&nbsp;a&nbsp;candidates application if they had a letter that was written with me as the audience.&nbsp; And remember the letter is not a class assignment.&nbsp; Write it like you are writing to a human being.</p>
<p>Anyway deleting monster.com emails always frustrates me.</p>

  <p>When my brother was in 8th grade, he brought home his school literary magazine, that took submissions from many students across the whole school. There was one piece of writing in there that was so full of insight that to this day I still recall the wisdom, and let it help in guiding my actions.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>One of the best tools out there if you do sysadmin stuff.</p>
<p>It is so worth reading the man page there are many many features to this wonderful tool.  One great one that I never really fully mastered is the copy and paste mode.  What follows are the copy and paste basics.  </p>
<p>
<!--more--></p>
<p>
At least enough to get started:</p>
<p>
C-a Esc</p>
<p>
Enter copy mode, you can now use vi like bindings to navigate the buffer.  Hit space to set the first mark, and then navigate (it will highlight) and hit space to set the second mark and throw the contents between the marks in the copy buffer.</p>
<p>
C-a > </p>
<p>
Write the copy buffer out to a file /tmp/screen-exchange</p>
<p>
C-a ]</p>
<p>
Paste into the current screen's stdin buffer.</p>
<p>
This little bit alone makes for a greatly enhanced screen experience.  But read through the man page there are tons of little gems.  This is evidenced by one of the entries the Bugs section of the man page:</p>
<p>
"- A weird imagination is most useful to gain full advantage of all the features."</p>

  <p>Like Sports?  Like Fiction?  Go to my brother's new site <a title="Sport is stranger than Fiction" href="http://sportfiction.com/">Sport is stranger than Fiction</a>  and read some of the stories.  He got a bunch of his writer friends who happen to enjoy sports, probably too much.  To help contribute.  It is in the early days, but there are a few stories there.  And humor is a primary focus.
Enjoy.</p>

  <p>My current bout with some upper respiratory virus has helped me learn that asthma probably is really not good to have.  For some reason my body responded to this infection by inflaming the airway and packing my lungs with mucus.</p>
<p>But I felt like I had an iron band around my chest for 2 days.</p>
<p>
The good news is my doctor gave me some medicine that should help me avoid iron band syndrome until the virus is done with me.</p>

  <p>In order to take over the world any world, you have to spend a fair amount of time goal setting and thinking about the big game.  And then planning for it.  This comes at great conflict with the normal newspaper reading, TV watching and other mindless religions we make for ourselves that are so compelling.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>As a follow up to my entry about people who pay attention.</p>
<p>There are certain people I have, and do, work with that probably feel I don't pay attention at times.  But it is far from the truth.  I have found certain people are fly off the handle excitable with new ideas.  And much like purchasing a handgun in some states, I sometimes implement a mandatory waiting period before taking action on their requests.  </p>
<p>
Often waiting for their second request to actually do anything about it, because a good percentage of those ideas and requests for action die their own necessary death without wasting too much of my very valuable time :)</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Although apparently packed with losers <a href="http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2006/11/are_smart_peopl.html">Mensa does have one charming quality according to Scott Adam's</a></p>
<p>
<blockquote>Mensa meetings are the strangest experience. No one ever has to explain anything twice. That’s a bigger deal than you might think. Your typical day is full of moments where you ask for a cup of coffee and someone hands you a bag of nails. You don’t realize how much time you spend re-explaining things until you no longer need to. Mensa is very cool that way.</p></blockquote>
<p>
It would be great to have people pay attention to you the first time.  I would say I spend a very large part of my day not only repeating myself, but reciting from memory the contents of emails I had sent, and recounting the detail in voicemail that I left for people.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Always Available Society Problems]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>One of the worst parts of being part of the "Always Available Society" is cell phones in public bathrooms.  For some reason it is taboo now-a-days to not be instantly available to every person all the time.  As part of that it is unheard of to not answer your phone when it rings, even if you are taking a dump.</p>
<p>What the hell is that about?  Is that the evolution of our society, because if so, let me out.  I walked into the bathroom at work and not 1 but 2 people were on cell phones, one guy standing at a urinal with his neck at an extreme angle trying to pinch his cell phone to his ear while he zipped up, and another sitting in a stall.  Both chatting away.  </p>
<p>
Here is what I plan to do about it.</p>
<p>
1. I am going to not answer the phone in the bathroom, or most other times really, I hate the telephone.</p>
<p>
2. If I call you and you are busy, feel free to call me back when you have time to talk.</p>
<p>
3. If I am talking to you and I feel the urge to evacuate my bowels or my bladder, I'll get off the phone first.</p>
<p>
4. When in the bathroom with people on the phone I am going to make as much obscene noise as possible.  And throw out such standard bathroom chatter as "How's it hanging?"</p>
<p>
Here is an observation and a question:</p>
<p>
Mister shoulder holder slunk out of the bathroom without washing up, so clearly when on the phone it is important to not disrupt your conversation to wash your hands.  What decision did mister stall talker make about wiping?  I don't know, because I got the hell outta there.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Making Noise: Dell Dimension E521 Linux USB problems]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Just wanted to get more noise out there that the new E521 distributed by Dell isn't working right under Linux.  Specifically I have tried Ubuntu 6.06 But there are others reporting problems with other distros and lots of different people trying different kernels.</p>
<p>Anyway, I have started a thread on the <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=279626">ubuntuforms</a> and one on <a href="http://forums.us.dell.com/supportforums/board/message?board.id=sw_other&message.id=54328&view=by_date_ascending&page=1">Dell's forums</a> that are getting a fair amount of traffic.  I have also contacted Dell support with no luck, but I suggest everyone who bought this system with the intent to run Linux contact support too, making noise that they can see may help push some results.  I also put a feeler out to <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/support/paid">Canonical</a> about maybe purchasing support to address this issue.</p>
<p>
I am holding off submitting a bug to the Ubuntu guys because they have their hands full with tomorrows release, plus I want to try out Edgy and see how it runs.  If I can reproduce the problem there I will submit the bug and renew some detailed troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
But if you are looking for a new machine and you want to run linux on it and don't want any problems, forget Dell and go for <a href="http://system76.com/index.php">system76</a>.  I can't speak for their quality or support because I haven't tried it, but I can say if I had this to do over I would have just ordered a similar machine for slightly higher cost from them.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Turns out to be super easy, there are long how to docs out there that deal with all the trivialities and different scenarios, but basically if you have ssh access to a server that is the SMB server you simply need to do this:</p>
<p>ssh -f -N -g -L 9000:localhost:139 <serverip></serverip></p>
<p>
and then you can simply mount it to a directory by doing:</p>
<p>
sudo mount -t smbfs -o username=USERNAME,password=PASSWORD,ip=localhost,port=9000 //SERVERNAME/SHARE /mnt/remoteshare</p></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>A euphemism for imprisonment I have heard is, "Making little piles out of big piles."  This is referring to times when prisoners were used to do menial jobs, and when those jobs weren't available, or maybe there was some use in this, they would spend all day breaking big rocks onto small rocks.</p>
<p>A thought just flew into my head as I was organizing the numerous tasks I have to try and fit into my day, that management and specifically information work can be summed up by making little piles out of big piles.</p>
<p>
There has to be a better way.</p>

I am glad to see that riddle # 3 had a few people missed it.  Not that I take delight that someone got it wrong, rather that it wasn't a very easy one.  It is fraught with misdirection, the obvious guess is a promise or something along those lines, but oddly that is too deep of a thought the correct answer is "Silence."</p>
<p>
Of course my wife already knew that one again, but let's see if she has an answer for this one.</p>

<p>#2's easy and obvious answer was of course "a River" I took some heat for making it too easy, but once you know they answer to one it always seems easy and obvious.  This seems very easy to me, but I hope it's a little more challenging.</p>
<p>I have been enjoying the fact that people actually bother to answer these.  I am going to try and consistently put some up here.  If you have any you want to share send them to mclazarus@gmail.com</p>

  <p>It seems you have to keep on top of your domain registrations if you don't want them to expire.  luckily no one was clamoring to get their hands on mcallister.ws.  But fans of my brother's website will be glad to know that mcallister.ws is now locked up until 2011.  Hopefully I remember to renew it then too.
Unfortunately I couldn't snarf it with my preferred registrar, they were showing it as not available.  I had to go back to register.com, luckily they upgraded their site and I don't have to email support to get them to set the name servers to mine instead of theirs.</p>
<p>Anyway my wife should be able to check her email no problem after the DNS gods are satisfied with the propagation time.  Thank's Michelle for noticing the problem before  someone snapped it up.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Finally a New PC]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Well I am getting tired of the ASPRE laptop (mycroft) that doesn't boot and when it does capital 'w' can't be typed with the right shift key and the machine I built about 6 years ago (sherlock) not booting right, and struggling with some other issues, and just having a computer that is no longer zippy enough for the bloated crap I want to run on it.
So I finally broke down and ordered a Dell Dimension E521 (Dual Core AMD 64 X2 4200+ 1GB 533 MHz DDR2 160 GB SATA drive)  Actually a really good deal I think, I did a whole bunch of research and I think I could have gotten a similar machine for slightly less but got scared off by comments at reseller ratings.  Paid $639 no monitor, a low end video card Geforce 7300 LE (that blows my current one away) of course the Geforce 6150 that is integrated into the Mobo of this new CPU  blows my current one away.  I couldn't find the right incantation  to get into Dell's site where I could just not get the PCIx card and deal with the integrated one, and also get XP Media Center version and get 2% off for ordering through a link on Temple's site.  My plan is to eventually save some bucks and buy a kickin video card and probably another disk to use the RAID capability.  This new machine I will call Gilead.
I even went to newegg and a few other sites to price out the components and I couldn't beat the deal.  It seems the world has moved on.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Masala Chai]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>We have one of those <a href="http://www.keurig.com/">Keurig</a> coffee makers at work, and while I despise coffee I love Tea, especially Earl Grey and Green Tea.  I have managed to keep that stocked here pretty well through various cajoling and convincing one other co-worker to imbibe the Earl Grey.  </p>
<p>With our latest order we just got a sample pack of Gloria Jean's Chai, and it may turn into my new mini-obsession, has a nice Cinnamon taste, and was very refreshing.  Actually when I first started drinking I was disappointed it smelled very much like Cinnamon, which is clearly the most superior of all spices, but the taste was pretty weak.  I did a quick search and found <a href="http://www.odie.org/chai/whatisit.html">here</a> that "chai must have sweetness or the spices seem to lose their full robustness."  I added one packet of Splenda and found the spice emboldened and embiggened, much to my enjoyment.</p>
<p>
I now have to hide the remaining 4 packs from the sample and then somehow get more in here.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Saving Money on textbooks]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I am pretty proud about the way I have saved money on texts in college, and I bug people with the stories often.  Recently I saw a chance to share this with the world because the folks at <a title="Lifehacker" href="http://lifehacker.com/">lifehacker</a> <a title="Cheap Textbooks" href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/back-to-school/ask-the-readers--cheap-textbooks-197494.php">asked about it</a>, so I sent them the email, got my invite to comment and commented.  But decided I would throw the same tips and stuff up here, because, well as I said I am proud of them.  So if you are looking for ways to stick it to the man when it comes to college textbooks, read on.
<!--more--> There are lots of ways to save money on textbooks, clearly using
firefox plugins like <a href="http://bookburro.org/">bookburo</a> are top of the list, but
here is how I saved before it was as easy to find inexpensive books
for sale on the net.</p>
<p>First realize there are three types of books, ones you want to keep,
ones you want only for the class at hand, and ones that are totally
unecessary to do well in the class and the professor just threw it on
to his list as it would help explain some concepts more deeply.  (Sure
you are there to learn primarily, but ya gotta have money to eat)</p>
<p>With that realization your first thing to do is find out from the
professor his plans for the book, if they are really optional then
don't bother buying it, or share with a friend or group of friends.</p>
<p>Okay, now we are at the point of books you need and you either want
them or only want them to use for the class.  So books you want, find
the best price using the internet or finding upperclassman or alumni
who have an older version or even the current version of some timeless
texts.</p>
<p>Now the interesting part, books you need temporarily, first verify it
isn't at your colleges library, if it is, you are set, borrow it and
if necessary pay the late fees at the end of the semester if it lasts
longer than your renewals will take you.  $2.50 for the rental of a
$80 book for 15 weeks is a nice savings.</p>
<p>If your school library doesn't have it, check local public libraries,
you will be suprised what some carry.  Again late fees can be
justified in the overall goal of saving money.  If you get no luck
there check if your school has relationships with other school
libraries, these may get you access to the library but not the ability
to take out the book.  You can now decide if it is worth an
underhanded trick.  You can hope the book will be there each time you
return to study or do your homework.  Or you can find a hiding place
in the library where you can retreive the book but prevent the other
schools students from checking it out.  This is up to your own ethics
on how you feel about this tactic, but it will save you money.</p>
<p>Finally there is ILL or Inter-Library Loan.  Your school library or
even public library may have the ability to borrow books on your
behalf and lend them to you from a very large number of sources.  If
you can find the book put in the request.  You usually can't get these
for terribly long, but depending on the professors strategy with the
text you just have to put your request in at the right time and you
may have it for the time you need it.  There is also the concept of
extending the borrowing, and finally late fees here can be much less
expensive than the actually book.</p>
<p>One of the keys to all of these strategies is timing.  You need to be
on the ball for any of these things to work, otherwise your classmates
will beat you to the punch.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Spam Lottery]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I won the Spam lottery!  Some jerk on an Israeli ISP decided to use my email address as the sender on a bunch of junk he sent out last night.</p>
<p>So today I got to learn all about how well the Barracuda SPAM firewall works, how many bad addresses this dude had on his list, and finally how many people are on vacation, or neglected to turn off their on vacation auto-reply.</p>
<p>
I think the solution to this is to train the Bayesian filter that is built into spam assassin a couple extra times today.  Of course the only downside to that is I may never see a legitimately bounced email again.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Today I learned that sometimes if you wait long enough your problem goes away.  Actually I always knew that, but this was in a positive way.  I kept assuming something wasn't working when in reality it was just taking longer to get an IP address than it should have.  But what's 7 minutes among friends.</p>
<p>I also learned that budgeting and paying your bills is a good thing.  I wasn't behind on anything, but boy did I owe a lot of money.  Expensive wifely birthday presents, children being born, Fantasy leagues being financed and car inspections all conspired to beat me senseless financially.</p>
<p>
Now I am going to take a shot at following the simple budgeting advice at <a href="http://www.gettingfinancesdone.com/blog/archives/2006/08/how-to-create-a-zero-based-budget/">Getting Finances Done</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Broken Computer Season]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Apparently it is broken computer season, I have had several family members dutifully report their computer problems to me over the past two weeks.  Let's hope we have reached the limit, I can't take the excitement of many more of these.</p>
<p>Also maybe it's a coincidence but 2 of them were my Mom and my brother and both of their issues are already fixed, the other two are Michelle's Aunt and her Mom.  And those issues are still broken.  Actually her aunt had the misfortune of calling me on Fantasy draft weekend, and I just heard about my Mother-in-Law's today.</p>
<p>
Hopefully I can work on getting out of much more of this type of repair.  Maybe if these folks got a look at my sad slow and non-booting computers at home they would be reluctant to call me at all.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I often find myself overwhelmed with paper.  I have a pretty good system to manage the stuff I know what to do with, but when I get a thing that I am not sure if I should keep, plus maybe things that have sentimental value, I feel strange tossing them, but I don't know where to put them.</p>
<p>Any of the 3 people out there that read this know of a good value scanner that works well with Linux?  I have a Visioneer 5300 USB that I have had for years.  It does not work with Linux in the least, and I think getting it to work with WinXP is a chore so I am looking to upgrade, hopefully for free or possibly cheaper.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Linux Desktop Reminders]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Not that anyone reads this, and the few that do, (my family) will have no comment on this.  But I figured I would throw it out there anyway.  </p>
<p>How can I have good reminders time/date based reminders on the linux desktop.  The calendar itself is not as important as the reminders, the ability to quickly and easily set and edit those reminders.  Evolution would seem to be ideal except that it has a habit of locking up a few times a week and also has a habit of forgetting to remind me of stuff.</p>
<p>
If there were a service in gnome that sat on the notification area, and let me use the google calendar with alerts, and also updated the gnome date time applet with some basic appointment details that would rule.  But I find myself with half finished kludges and tools that want to do all the work themselves like Sunbird and a bunch of other stand alone apps.</p>
<p>
Anyway I am seeking suggestions, does anyone who uses a linux desktop have a simple system for remembering to do things at specific times?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ignore this and all future posts, if you value your sanity]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>For some time I have been extremely busy and my websites have been almost entirely ignored.  (Whaaaa?  Someone is actually reading this?!  You really should clean up your feeds and delete the ones you don't read!)  Since I now have two children, a busy startup to engineer at, and other sundry work I will probably continue to ignore it.
But I did actually get around to upgrading the site to wordpress 2.0.4, Installed a different wordpress to <a title="livejournal" href="http://mclazarus.livejournal.com/">livejournal </a>crossposter (maybe this one will crosspost entries I send from my camera phone) and checked in on my google adwords.</p>
<p>Seems ignorance somtimes pays off, at least a little.  I am about $3 from getting a check from google, afterward I will probably pull the ads because it makes the site look cheesy.</p>
<p>Anyway the renewed interest is temporarily sparked by some ideas I had for some quick software projects I hope to churn out, which also probably won't happen.  But I like to think it will, and instead of actually working on the task I have in mind, I decided to upgrade my blog software.  Figure that one out for me.
Anyway, here is hoping that Google accidentally prints way too many zeros on my $100 check, and here is to going to get some sleep.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[asking questions in email]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>How the heck do you get someone to answer more than one question in an email?  I have read lots of email ettiquite articles, and I pride myself on concise emails that tell you something simple, ask a question or two or delegate some sort of action.  But very often I send an email with 2 or 3 questions, because I need to know something like:
1. Have you handled xyz?
2. If yes, something specific about the handling?</p>
<p>And the response I will get is.  "Yep I handled it." or "Yes" or in a very special instance I have gotten my own emails forwarded to me with the simple line "FYI"  :-/</p>
<p>Of course while the last example above is true, it is not central to my question here.  How do you get someone to not just selectively answer one of your questions, in my experience it is either the first question or the last question.  Or they respond to your initial setup of the context of the email.</p>

  <p>A friend of mine recently released a gmail notify applet for Linux.  [gmnotify](http://gmnotify.sourceforge.net/) from what I can tell it is pretty sweet compared to some of the alternatives.  Go ahead and check it out.  That is if you use gmail and want little windows popping up telling you that you got an email.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>tomorrow a little before 5 AM I will be hitting the road to go to the IC and see what passes for fun there for a few action packed days while I help my <a href="http://tom.mcallister.ws/">brother</a> pack all his posessions into a little steel box to be shipped to somewhere in Jersey, watch him officially get his Master of Fine Arts in Writing or English or something.  Check out $3 car-bombs, and fly back to Philly while he drives so I can resume work on ye olde dungeon, also known as my new "study."
Look forward to a flury of pic postings here using flickr's interface and my Samsung a900.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Patience]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Today I advocate patience as an often overlooked quality for improving business.  This is a direct attack on the often used axiom referring to "low hanging fruit."  The basic idea there is, pick the simplest thing to do first.  And the rationale is mostly sound, the idea is that you have to do it anyway, and it will make an impact on your environment and workload so get to it.  Why are you still sitting around looking at that low hanging fruit, pick it for goodness sake the work day is a wastin.
But I have to imagine that anyone who picks fruit for a living is thinking, if I fill up my basket with the low fruit, it'll be a real pain in the ass to climb up a ladder lugging a basket that is partially or mostly filled with fruit.</p>
<p>The point here is that business analogies are mostly stupid and can be construed anyway the proveyor of the proverb would like.  So instead of planning your workday/week/month on some phrase of the day.  Take a minute to think first.  Decide what is important to do.  I know humans are usually stupid and thinking about many factors at the same time is hard, but at least you aren't running around like a maniac jumping on top of the fruit that has already fallen to the ground thinking you are doing something special.  </p>
<p>Understand that anything worth doing, is worth doing well, and sometimes to do something well takes time, focus, and forethought.  Just because something can be done quickly doesn't make it a better thing to do.  It only takes 5 seconds to check email, but you all know that guy who literally spends 2 - 3 hours of their day chomping on that low hanging fruit.  </p>
<p>Try being patient, understand that things take time to do, and use that knowledge to decide what is important.  Make gains on your goals daily.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Imagine if you will a middle aged man, mild mannered by day, but by weekend he is a drug mule, pulling up stakes from his family life and shooting down to that hot bed of drug activity, Virginia!  Bringing back automobiles made entirely of cocaine.  Described as quirky or old fashioned mostly, but he knows the score.  The question is, what is the street name for this character?</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>GM has been bombarding my television with ads saying that they are hard at work to save the world by ending our dependence on petroleum.  While I must say that I respect work to provide a renewable energy source.  I find the tone of the commercials funny.  I mean sure it would be great to drive a car that can run on old corn cobs and left over beer, but unless GM is running around retrofitting the corn farms equipment to not use giant oil guzzling machines we surely aren't ending any kind of petroleum dependence.
I mean the exposure is great and GM should be applauded for using some of the hours and hours and hours of commercial time they buy each year to raise awareness of alternative fuel sources.  But everyone should just think for a minute to know what they are buying into.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ESPN grasping at zebra colored straws]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I am very annoyed by the way the media is turning the actual story, an amazing second half of the season and postseason performance by the Pittsburgh Steelers, into a diatribe against the refereeing in the league.  I listened to the Jaws, Irvin and TJ say things like, "Every big play by Seattle was negated by a penalty."
<!--more--></p>
<p>But when you get down to it there were four plays people are complaining about.  Two of them weren't very important, heck one was a tackle by the QB, no matter what the call he still had thrown a crippling interception.  The two scoring plays in question, Big Ben's TD wouldn't be an issue if the official running in from the side wasn't indecisive.  But okay, he was, either way Pittsburgh was still on the 0 yard line with 1 more down, they were clearly coming away with points there.  </p>
<p>The other D-Jax's push off, was, well a push off.  I don't care if you take it down and play it frame by frame, the he made a cut, put his hand up on the defender and then gained separation from the defender.  If the hand didn't touch the defenders shoulder then I would agree it was a bad call.  But the official does not have the benefit of super slow motion instant replay, he is watching people move very quickly, and when one of them illegally contacts another he throws a flag, it doesn't matter if he only pushed a little, it was illegal and a good call.</p>
<p>And even worse than the national media saying this, is the losing head coach making comments about the officials in a public forum.  Holmgren, I don't care if you claim the ball was underinflated, or that the sun was in your eyes or that the ground was soggier on your side of the field.  You guys lost, and the biggest reason was that the Seattle gameplan was a clunker.  Consistently not running the ball in critical situations, and choosing to throw the ball 20+ yards on every 3rd down was the problem.  Plus the biggest problem you had, Pittsburgh was better.</p>

  <p>If you car won't start and you need to get it towed somewhere, AAA doesn't have a hard time hearing you tell them where you are, when you say.  I'm home.  Instead of at mile 237 on the turnpike.
Another advantage is, it doesn't matter much if the shop can't look at it today, because, well you weren't going anywhere tomorrow anyway.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Online software purchases]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I have learned a lesson, and paid for it with hassle.
I bought MS Money 2006 Deluxe online directly from microsoft and paid $40 or something like that, and then submitted their rebate and got half of it back.  This was in July.  I did it because well I have a lot of experience with MS Money and like it.  I thought about trying Quicken, but, I think Money does all I need.  </p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Anyway, the way you get it to work is download the crippled trial, then it uses the magic of your MSN account to know that it is authorized and downloads the parts it needs to uncripple itself.  Fine.  Except when a couple months later your daughter spills water on the laptop, fries a memory chip, and eventually you end up getting the machine working again, but somehow you unintentionally uninstalled MS Money during the fracas.  </p>
<p>So I figure, fine I'll reinstall... from what?  Well I guess I download the trial again and it will uncripple itself automagically.  No Dice.  It has no idea I should have the paid version.  So I start trying to figure out how to contact MS to fix it.  Seems I would have to register a credit card to call them or email their support and risk them charging me at least $100 if it turns out I am too stupid to find the checkbox that says it should be uncrippled.  This mental block is enough to keep me from doing it for a while.</p>
<p>Today I vow to do something about it, and I [look](http://www.roosster.com/rstr/) and see that I can buy MS Money 2006 Deluxe from Staples and if I buy Taxcut, I can get some rebate stuff.  Well I don't really want taxcut, but I see that I can get a $40 rebate, and I also find that Target has Taxcut Deluxe+State for $20, and MS Money 2006 Deluxe for $20.  And the rebate in question is offered from HR Block.  Therefore, I run to Target.  Pay $42.  And I will mail in a rebate form and get a $40 check in a couple weeks.  Sure I am out some effort and $2.  But the risk of paying potentially $100, and the added bonus of having an actual uncrippled CD to reinstall the software as I like outweighs that.</p>
<p>So I think the moral of this story is:
* Don't buy mass marketed stuff directly from the manufacturer because a better deal can surely be found from the purchasing power of a retail outlet.
* Don't buy downloadable software if you can get a hard copy of it for the same or less cost.
* If you wait until January you can most likely upgrade financial software for free.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sprint picture mail and the samsung a900]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>For Christmas both Michelle and I received Samsung A900 phones, and you are aware that it has a reasonable camera if you spend any time looking at this site at all, because I have posted a picture from it almost once daily since I got it.
There is, however, a problem with the Sprint picture mail service and this phone.  And it is acknowledged by Sprint if you call it's a known issue.  The issue is that basically you tell the message to send, and it doesn't it sits in a pending box on your phone.  Their work around is to retry and if that doesn't work, then delete it from pending and resend.</p>
<p>Their workaround is clearly garbage, because it takes me forever to type a subject and sometimes a message on the picture, so I am not deleting and retyping the message.  They also promise a phone update that will fix the problem.  And **no** the most recent update doesn't fix it.  </p>
<p>I have found a work around that works almost every time.  After telling your picture to send, wait until the fancy EVDO indicator fades back to idle mode.  Then launch the browser, wait until the page loads up, hit "end" and then immediately go back to your pending mailbox and "re-send."  This seems to work nearly every time.</p>
<p>I also tried calling Sprint back to tell them this work around, but I didn't get a very good tech on the other end and they didn't understand what I was talking about.  Here's hoping they release a fix soon... I guess in the mean time I should call again and complain and try and get service credit.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Requesting good naming for the impatient (MySQL)]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I guess I am impatient, and I don't want to read everything, and therefore I demand of people that effect my life choose good names for stuff.  The current complaint is about MySQL's privilege system.  [Apparently](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/4.1/en/grant.html) USAGE privilege is a synonym for âno privileges.â?
Any reason, why this can't simply be NONE, or "TOO FEW PRIVILEGES TO BOTHER MENTIOING" or anything besides a word that makes it look like something?</p>
<p>Yes I get the low level irony of me claiming to be impatient and taking the time to write this rant.  But if you think about it, I have now seared this into my memory with this 5 minute interlude.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Selling Used Books with Amazon]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I have had a pretty good experience seeling with Amazon.  But I never really paid attention to the selling fee structure, because I was happy to just make a few bucks on most of my books.  But on friday I got the notice that another of my books sold.  I charged $2.50, I got paid for standard shipping.  But the Amazon fee came out to be $2.60.
Well, shit, I ain't about giving my books away and paying for the privilege.  I would rather burn it than pay Amazon 10 cents for the privilege of shipping it to someone else.  I looked into it, and yes of course I am in the wrong.  I mean they have it all laid out.  They take 99 cents and then some %age of the sale, and then some closing cost.  Which is purposely confusing so that you will sign up to pay them a monthly fee to sell with some advanced account, so you can waive some of those fees.  </p>
<p>Fine I get it they want to make money.  But damn, I only have maybe a grand total of 20 books I want to sell in a year, and that is on the high end.  So clearly half.com is the answer for me.  (they just charge a %age of the sale)</p>
<p>But just a reminder to myself, don't list for under $3 with amazon.  And probably don't list with Amazon any more.</p>
