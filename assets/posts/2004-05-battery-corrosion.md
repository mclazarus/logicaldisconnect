  <p>My <a href="http://aiptek.com/products/digital/mini.htm">Aiptek mini pencam</a> went neglected for a while, the joys of home ownership reduced not only my free time but also my ability to find the camera.  It has recently been located, but I found that alkaline batteries that I left inside had begun to cause corrosion on the contacts.  I brushed some of it away at the bottom, but when I put batteries in, I found that it wasn't working.  I feared the worst, and ignored it for a couple of days.  But it occured to me that I never tended to the corrosion that was up on the spring contacts at the top of the battery bay.  I googled a bit and found that you can use a baking soda paste to clean it away chemically.  However, I didn't bother with that, I just got a screwdriver and flaked a bunch of it off of the spring, and behold, the camera lives again.
Now the only thing I need to do, is install some kind of recessed switch to actually physically break the contact of the battery, as it just sits there and drains the battery even when it is "off."  Right now a piece of post-it serves that purpose for me.</p>
<p>But this should provide for some nice 1.3 MP shots at the bike race.  I am even considering looking to see if I can get a hold of the <a href="http://aiptek.com/products/digital/pkx.htm">pocket cam x</a> to play with and take some 2.1 MP shots, and see if the flash actually makes it useful indoors.  However I haven't found any reviews or example pics from that, which makes me skeptical.  Also I'd like to find a refurb or something so I don't have to pay a full $100.</p>
