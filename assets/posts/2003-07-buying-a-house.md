  <p>Apparently buying a house is the thing to do nowadays.  But man there are some people that are out of their mind with their listings.  They have houses that just a couple of years ago were worth maybe $125k.  And now they are asking $225+.  Obviously the astoundingly low interest rates offset that by increasing my buying power.  But it makes it nearly impossible to put 20% down which means I either need to get Personal Mortgage Insurace or arrange a separate deal with my lender to get a second mortgage which just covers the difference between my downpayment and what it would take to get to 20%.  Not to mention the effect it has on tax.
And the other factor is that a house is an investment.  Is there any possible way that the cost of a house will go up from what I purchase it at now?  It looks to me like RHAT at $160/share or QCOM at $400/share or whatever their outrages all time highs were.  If I settle for something I don't really want but can afford, I may be stuck there for a long time unless I want to sell at a loss.  (I wonder if there are any tax breaks for people who lose on property investments?  And are they limited to some value like $2K a year such as securities investments on the Schedule D).  Just more research I need to do.</p>
<p>Well I think the primary key here is patience.  Houses are flying on and off the market, I just need to find the right one and negotiate the right deal.  If anyone wants to give me 30 or 40 thousand dollars let me know.</p>
<p>BTW, if anyone out there wants to hire a teacher who is excellent yet underpaid and under appretiated by the rotten Philadelphia School district.  Let me know.</p>
