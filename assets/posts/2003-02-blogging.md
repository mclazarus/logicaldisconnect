<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>After putting it off for a long time I have finally begun working on my    web presence. I originally had a lame web site in 1995 when I lived in <a href="http://www.drexel.edu/" shape="rect">Drexel's</a> 
    dorms. It must have been there for a good 50 or 60 days before I decided 
    the 16 MB of ram in my PowerMac 7100/66 would do better not running <a href="http://www.stairways.com/netpresenz" shape="rect">Netpresenz</a>. 
    It was really cutting into my <a href="http://www.bungie.com/products/marathon/marathon.htm" shape="rect">marathon</a> 
    performance. Anyway since that day I had vowed to build myself a website. 
    Well you know how it is, you either don't have time, aren't motivated, or 
    don't want to do anything half-assed. Well turns out the only way anything 
    every gets done is half-assed, at least at first. For a discussion of that 
    see Joels commentary on <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000339.html" shape="rect">Fire 
    and Motion</a>. So my entry site LIVES: <a href="http://mcallister.ws/" shape="rect">Kevin 
    D. McAllister, Engineer</a>, and I am launching this weblog at the same 
    time. And yes it is half-assed and yes, I am jumping on the blogging 
    bandwagon. Not because I think people care, but because I am lazy and 
    opinionated. This way I don't have to talk to people, I can just provide 
    links to my rants. Also I have found that I keep redoing and relearning 
    the same things. So eventually, I can just google my archives, and spend 
    the free time playing basketball. Anyway, I am going to give this a shot 
    for a while, it seems to be addictive to those that do it. So, maybe 
    someone will find it useful.</p>
