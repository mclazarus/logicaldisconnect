<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I am trying to get a list of some of the things people wish they had learned earlier than they did.  Like a life lesson, or something that life experience showed you that once you knew, you said, "Why don't they teach this in school?"  I would have acted differently had I understood this.
It is anything from small things to large life changing things.  I am trying to come up with things to make sure I expose my children to, so they have a chance to learn it early in life.</p>
<p>Obviously some things only come from experience and making enough of the same mistakes, but get the experience early enough it may click in faster.</p>
<p>An example of a broad topic here that I wish I had understood sooner, is money, investing and compound interest.  How about you?</p>
