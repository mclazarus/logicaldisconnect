<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Blogcaster is ready for it's initial release.  It is very simple, has some warts which are annoying, but I can throw quick posts up with relative ease.  Once I figure out the complicated SourceForge release process, I can have the linux version up there.  And I probably will have to wait until I get home to get the Windows version up there.  Unless I get motivated to mess around with the ant script some more today to build the windows version.</p>
