  <p>A tweet or facebook status update was too short and unformatted to capture this and I had to write it immediately.
Michelle was singing to the girls after the most packed day at Disney. (started at Animal Kingdom around 9:30 and finally got back to the Pop Century resort at 10:50 after seeing Fantasmic).</p>
<p>Ashley stops Michelle singing saying, "Wait! You forgot to put Minnie in my song."</p>
<p>Michelle: "I put her in, I said Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Daisy and Pluto"</p>
<p>Ashley: "Oh! I thought you meant Pluto the planet."</p>
<p>Allison: (immediately and with obvious exasperation) Ash, Pluto's not even a planet!"</p>
