<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Even though my father used to call today Saint Hallmark's day, and at many levels I agree with him that it is purely a marketing ploy to sell junk.  I think it's as good an excuse as any to pledge my undying love to Michelle.
Happy Valentine's Day, Michelle, I Love YOU!</p>
<p>Yeah I know it's sappy, so what?</p>
<p>Oh and Happy Valentine's Day Allison, maybe your mom will read this to you, and maybe someday you'll know what it means.</p>
