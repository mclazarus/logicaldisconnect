<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I am sure many of you checked out all or part of the debates.  And if you are like me you often wondered if some of the exact, very conveniently round figures that were thrown out by the candidates resembled in any way the truth.  Well it seems there is a seemingly good resource on the Internet for that analysis: <a href="http://factcheck.org/">FactCheck.org</a>.
So it seems <a href="http://factcheck.org/article.aspx@docID=275.html">Bush does own a timber company</a>.</p>
<p>Not that it matters much, but at least there are some other things there that we can review and look for a kernel or two of truth.</p>
