  <p>There is nothing that makes me feel worse than unexpected bills.  And I am not talking about jerks named William, or the Buffalo variety.  I got jackasses crawling out of the woodwork to charge me for crap that happened many months ago.  The IRS is trying to wing me for a nice chunk of change they claim that I didn't claim correctly.  And now apparently Aetna wanted to pay half for home phototherapy to treat Allison's jaundice.  Seriously that had to be quite cheaper than her being at the hospital for 3 days to get the same treatment.  Would they have half-assed me on that too?  And since all of this happened in December, and Aetna decided not to pay in January, how come I don't hear about it until September.
Good Grief.</p>
