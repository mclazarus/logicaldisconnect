<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>MobileMe Calendar finally got me past the occasional frustration and issues on my calendar sync solution.  They did this by breaking my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine">Rube Goldbergian</a> solution completely and having me setup a much simpler system.
My prior solution was like this, Google calendar for my work domain was my main calendar.  But when I first got an iPhone there was no two way sync between Google calendar and the iPhone, but I could sync using MobileMe between my phone and my desktop.  So I got a piece of software called BusySync (which I later upgraded to BusyCal), this would sync the Google Calendar to my desktop iCal store which would then be synchronized via MobileMe to my phone.  And it mostly worked.  I had my calendar on the web, on my desktop and on my phone and could make changes in any of those 3 places.  Although sometimes it would do weird things and I had to keep BusyCal always running on my work computer to keep everything going.</p>
<p>Recently I unthinkingly upgraded MobileMe to the new Calendar.  Which of course broke all of that for various reasons.  And this turned out to be the best thing I could do, as now I have a much simpler solution that seems to accomplish the same goals and work more reliably.</p>
<p>Now my phone synchronizes with the Google calendar directly using ActiveSync.  And my desktop and laptop BusyCal synchronize with Google calendar directly but only need to be running when I need a calendar there.  So MobileMe solved my occasional calendar problems by becoming useless for me.  </p>
<p>At this point I'll have to evaluate if there is any point to keeping MobileMe at all or if I can simply use DropBox to keep the other things in sync that MobileMe does for me, and I certainly don't need another email account, or IM account and their iDisk solution is a joke compared to the ease of Dropbox.</p>
<p>Is there any other value to this service I'm missing?</p>
