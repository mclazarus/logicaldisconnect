  <p>If only they would have told me that the seller's facility was in Horsham, I would have been glad to go pick it up.

<p>So was my [valuable merchandise](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?path=ASIN/1590593197&amp;link_code=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=logicaldiscon-20&amp;creative=9325)  really just around the corner?  Or does this mean that the UPS tracking system is FUBAR?  Either way I ordered on Saturday, the 27th, and it wasn't until shortly after my complaint email, about them not shipping yet, was responded to by Amazon that I got shipment notification.  The good news is I got $5 for my annoyance.  So it goes to prove "If things don't go your way, just keep complaining until your dreams come true." -[President Clinton](http://www.snpp.com/episodes/BABF09)</p>
