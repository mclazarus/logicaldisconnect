<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>This is posted with <a href="https://bloged.dev.java.net/" shape="rect">BlogEd</a>, which seems to be pretty simple, but has fancy WYSIWYG stuff in it. Java web start looks pretty cool, at least it worked on my home machine without any fuss. Of course I do not know how to open the program again.  Anyway here is wondering if the inline image stuff works:

<p><em>Updated</em>: to remove all kinds of crazy markup that BlogEd put into the entry.  I ended up posting 3 entries and thought I lost one before I figured out how to use it.  Plus swing is still icky.  The inline picture worked which was really cool. </p>
