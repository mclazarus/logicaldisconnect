<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I have just begun reading Franz Kafka's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?tag=logicaldiscon-20&location=/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553213695%3FSubscriptionId=048656PF073H3HPEQ4G2" title="View product details at Amazon">The Metamorphosis</a> which I have a dead tree copy of (somewhere), because I read it in high school, but the palm version from <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a> is much <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/5200">more handy</a> at this time.  I remembered liking it before.  What's not to like about becoming a horrible vermin?</p>
