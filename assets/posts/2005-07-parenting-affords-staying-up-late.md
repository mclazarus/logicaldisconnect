<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I have figured out why the people I know with young children don't get up at 5 AM to go to the gym.  Because they all stay up late, they stay up late because that hanging out time period that used to last from 6 PM until 9 or 10.  Now doesn't start until 9 or 9:30 when the critters are busy counting sugar plums.  It turns out that short time period I used to take for granted for playing PS2, reading stuff, <a href="http://barrelhousemag.blogspot.com/2005/07/when-harry-potter-fans-attack.html">working on my aquaman suit</a> or doing any other random thing is now 4 hours of live action romper room.  I'm not complaining, but I certainly don't feel like going to bed at 9:30 or 10 like I used to, I have much more important things to do, like type up swill to slop up on my blog.  The question is when do I go to the gym?  And the answer certainly has nothing to do with a home gym.  That doesn't work for me, it is too easy to cover with laundry.  It probably has something to do with just getting up anyway.  Or taking advantage of the fact that I am working from home and going to the gym at 6 or 7 instead of 5.</p>
