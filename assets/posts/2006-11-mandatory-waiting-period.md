<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>As a follow up to my entry about people who pay attention.</p>
<p>There are certain people I have, and do, work with that probably feel I don't pay attention at times.  But it is far from the truth.  I have found certain people are fly off the handle excitable with new ideas.  And much like purchasing a handgun in some states, I sometimes implement a mandatory waiting period before taking action on their requests.  </p>
<p>
Often waiting for their second request to actually do anything about it, because a good percentage of those ideas and requests for action die their own necessary death without wasting too much of my very valuable time :)</p>
