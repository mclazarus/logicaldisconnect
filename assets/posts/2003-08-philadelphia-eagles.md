  <p>The best season of the year is again starting up.  Football season!  And the best team in the league is getting ready to play their first preseason game Monday night against the Saints.
I can't wait to get tickets to <a href="http://www.lincolnfinancialfield.com/home.jsp">The Linc</a>, to see the <a href="http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/">Eagles</a> play some football.  And tickets go on sale tomorrow!</p>
<p>My brother and his friends have decided their best bet is to get in line a day in advance at the local Ticketmaster outlet.  I am going to try my luck on the phone.  Hopefully I am successful, for the sole reason that they are my wife's birthday present.</p>

EAGLES!!!!</p>
