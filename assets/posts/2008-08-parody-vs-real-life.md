<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I defy you to explain to me the difference between [ Barack Obama's sentiment](http://www.demconvention.com/barack-obama/), "We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country."  And the one uttered by Kang in [Treehouse of Horror VII](http://www.snpp.com/episodes/4F02.html), "Abortions for some, miniature American flags for others."
American politics is not even trying to hide the fact that their words are absolutely meaningless and they are just trying to unlock the right combination to get elected.  Playing a high stakes crossword puzzle.</p>
<p>By the way, please don't interpret this as support for the Republicans.  Their allegiance with the [ Religious Right](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_right) is an outright attack on the first amendment and until they renounce this partnership I cannot even consider supporting their candidates.</p>
