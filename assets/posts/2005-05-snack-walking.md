<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Sometimes I want a snack, and rather than stopping myself I try and earn it, so I try and find a store that is in a reasonable walking distance and walk there for it.  Of course I like walking too so this all ties together.
Anyway I found a place to walk to that is about a 10 minute walk from my current place of employment <a href="http://www.google.com/local?q=en-route&num=100&hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&safe=off&near=Princeton,+NJ&radius=0&latlng=40348611,-74659444,15224657717685588123">En Route</a> at the Princeton Junction train station.  It would be about a 20 minute walk if I didn't know about a short cut through the swamp behind my office building.</p>
<p>Plus I got to see a bunch of cabbies standing around at the station telling jokes in some other language.</p>
