<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I just flew in from Houston, Texas and boy does flying in the winter in Philly suck.  Here is a quick recap of the experience:
<ul>
<li>Getting up at 3:30 AM for a 6 AM flight because of snow is not desirable.</li>
<li>Sitting in the plane waiting to de-ice while the AC is turned off, also, subpar</li>
<li>Houston claims to be the 4th largest city, however it seems to have claimed the distinction by expanding the borders to include the suburbs, where apparently everyone goes to by 7:30 PM.  Because the city is deserted then.  I could hear birds chirping, when they rig</li>
<p>htfully should have been drown out by traffic sounds, or killed off by pigeons.</p>
<li>six packs come in buckets full of ice in Texas</li>
<li>Charging food and transportation to the room is a great invention.</li>
<li>Having a chick-fil-a in a public cafeteria in the basement of an office building is a good idea</li>
<li>The banks that have ATMs in airports should go and move them to the other side of the TSA checkpoints.  If you are short on cash and need to get a cab and you have left the "secure" area, there could be trouble.  Incidently zone fares for cabs are good.</li>
<li>I don't understand the cow in the spacesuit that is in the George Bush airport.</li>
<li>Searching around for wireless connectivity is silly when there is an ethernet jack in your room.  (Note: Bring a network cable with you when you go anywhere)</li>
<li>70 degree weather in February is great, but I am sure glad I missed the 110+ degree weather that will be there in the summer</li>
<li>Venison isn't bad.</li>
<li>Travelling into a snow storm in philly is much more time consuming than travelling out of one.</li>
<li>Coming home is great</li>
</ul>
<p>Well that's it for now.</p>
