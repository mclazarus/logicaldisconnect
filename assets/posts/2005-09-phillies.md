<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Thanks to Chris & Jen, Michelle & I went to the Phillies game last night.  They whupped the Braves, and our seats were ridiculously good.  We sat in the first row of the section in left field.  So I could throw things at Burrell if I wanted to.  The only disapointment was that the three Homeruns that did go to left were either 1 section toward center, or way over our head, like the Andruw Jones's 50th on the season, that one was a shot.
Anyway It was a nice evening out, and the seats were great.  Although the Phillies continue to confound.  Just when everyone gives up on them, they sweep the Braves.  I had fun and even still managed to go to sleep too late.</p>
