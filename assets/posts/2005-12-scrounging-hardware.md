<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Anyone out there have a [mini-ITX](http://mini-itx.com/hardware/intro.asp) board, or any generally associated things like like a DC-DC ATX converter or and old 60 or 80 Watt laptop AC adapter, or some old low wattage ATX power supply that I could at least use for some prototyping or testing with said board?
Anyway, I obviously have a little project in mind.  I plan to mess around with [Asterisk](http://asterisk.org/) on one of these.  I'd like to get the lowest TCO home PBX system running that I can.  I may even consider a [Soekris](http://www.soekris.com/).  If I can get my hands on one relatively inexpensively.</p>
