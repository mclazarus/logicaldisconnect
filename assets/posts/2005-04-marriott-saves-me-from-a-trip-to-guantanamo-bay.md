  <p>So unless you have been living under a rock somewhere you know it is <a href="http://www.tsa.dot.gov/interweb/assetlibrary/Permitted_and_Prohibited_Items.pdf">frowned upon</a> to bring a knife onto an airplane.  You also probably know that they have a little lottery to decide if a passenger gets an extra special screening by the TSA.
Well I sometimes carry a Swiss Army Knife that was a Christmas Gift from my Aunt Judy, Uncle Dom and Niko.  I carry it in my backpack that I use to carry my laptop and what at times is a huge collection of electronics gear (usb drive, ipod, travel alarm clock, headphones, airline headphones, usb mouse, cell phone, wireless pcmcia card, laser pointer pen.)  Well I flew out of PHL today and the gear bag was at full capacity.  And I won the TSA lottery for extra inspection.</p>
<p>Of course I don't know the knife is in there.  And it turns out they don't either, even though I noticed the TSA worker looking quizically at my USB drive, and checking out my ipod.  It wasn't until I was talking to Michelle a few minutes ago that I noticed the knife while I was looking for my cell phone charger.</p>
<p>Dammit.  I have at least 3 more airplanes to get on.  And to pass TSA security at least twice more.    A knife has to light up like a christmas tree on the XRay machine, otherwise why the hell is the xray machine there.  I could check my bag.  What a PITA, especially since my original 2 flights and 1 of my subsequent flights were cancelled today.  Where would my laptop end up?</p>
<p>So I decide to try the "At your service" line at the <a href="http://marriott.com/property/propertypage/DFWAM">Marriot </a> I am staying in.  Well they hook it up, a fedex envelope is filled out and set to be shipped back toward my home, for hopefully not too much money.  Now I can avoid becoming a mainstay on the terrorist watch list, or avoid further disgust and embarssment as my tax dollars at work to protect the airways continue to miss finding a knife in my bag.</p>
