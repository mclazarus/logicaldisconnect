  <p>Apparently when Dell support schedules a dispatch, it is only an estimate.  And not only that, but if that estimate turns out to be wrong, it is the customers responsibility to track down that info.</p>
<p>So they know they are going to miss the date, but I wasn't able to find that out until I called them up and sat on hold, and went through the whole process of giving my service tag number, phone number and email address to the technician.  Then I needed to give him the dispatch number for the service (shouldn't that be in their database next to my service tag number?).  And he tells me, they had a stock issue shipping the part to the local technician and they estimate that the part will be in the techs hands on Monday March 3rd.</p>
<p>So a timely email with that information is beyond the capabilities of the mighty Dell</p>
<p>Apparently <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2003/02/10/news/funny/dude/">Benjamin Curtis</a> isn't the only guy associated with Dell who is is guilty of low cognitive ability.</p>
