<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I have dug up the relic from my college days, the <a href="http://www.palmone.com/us/support/palm3/">Palm III</a> mainly because I felt like doing some reading of the public domain stuff on the awesome <a href="http://promo.net/pg/">Project Gutenberg</a>.  The experience (which I tried before) has been great so far.  I am using <a href="http://gutenpalm.sourceforge.net/">The Weasel Reader</a> because of its use of the <a href="http://www.gzip.org/zlib/">zlib</a> compression algorithm, Trying to stretch those 2MB as far as they will go.
It has been great.  I am almost finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?tag=logicaldiscon-20&location=/exec/obidos/ASIN/076530953X%3FSubscriptionId=048656PF073H3HPEQ4G2" title="View product details at Amazon">Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom</a> by <a href="http://craphound.com/">Cory Doctorow</a> and the experience has been great.  First it's a pretty good story, that is available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">creative commons license</a> and I was able to read it very fast, because for some reason I was able to take my palm and read a few pages in lots of places that ordinarily would have warranted a raised eyebrow and some somewhat insulted/joking remarks about my being bored with their company if I was reading or even carrying a dead-tree book.</p>
<p>I'd recommend reading that book, or buying me a newer slightly smaller, with better resolution and more memory screen palm :), or checking out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?tag=logicaldiscon-20&location=/exec/obidos/ASIN/1568582862%3FSubscriptionId=048656PF073H3HPEQ4G2" title="View product details at Amazon">A Place So Foreign and Eight More</a> also by Doctorow, which I bought and recently finished.  Some good stuff in there.  I think he released some of those short stories under a creative commons license as well, <a href="http://craphound.com/place/">link</a>.</p>
