<p>I enjoyed Michael Lopp's article <a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2013/04/07/an_introduction_to_you.html">An Introduction to You</a>, specifically this part:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are in an incredible hurry building important things and have no time for nuance. We're impatient. We're busy. We want everything to move faster, so we make huge, comforting assumptions and slap easy to understand labels on complex concepts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Though I've been thinking little about the idea of oversimplifying and therefore over or under estimating the contribution of a new employee. Rather the quoted section made me think about how much is often missed in the "incredible hurry" when building products and the systems and processes to support a business.</p>

<p>It would have resonated more with me if he had written the exact same article but if it were not about an employee, but a new technology being integrated into the same busy-worshiping company culture.</p>
