  <p>If somehow you missed it, a few weeks ago the Whitehouse thought it would be a good idea to <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/facts-are-stubborn-things/">encourage citizens to report on other citizens</a> that were spreading "fishy" information about healthcare.  I promptly reported myself and asked to be added to the list of political enemies because Healthcare is a legitimate need of man, but to declare it as a right is to destroy all rights, see Ayn Rand's essay <a href="http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=arc_ayn_rand_man_rights">Man's Rights</a> for a detailed explanation.
That email address for reporting citizens has since <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0809/26188.html">been discontinued</a>.  While in the circles I travel I didn't hear anyone excuse this action by the Whitehouse, I have a fear that the majority of American citizens find nothing wrong with it or see it as something worthy of a passing chuckle at those who were outraged by this action.  I have nothing to say to the ones who would react in a laughing manner, meaning those that don't take ideas seriously, for the same reason I wouldn't try to teach a pig to sing.  For those that honestly wonder why such a thing is worth getting worked up about, I'd encourage you to think about <a href="http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=arc_ayn_rand_the_nature_of_government">The Nature of Government</a>, why it exists, and what effect such an entity would ultimately have on the spread of ideas while openly collecting a list of dissenters.  </p>
<p>Governments are properly formed to secure rights, not to provide goods & services, spread ideas or prevent the spread of ideas.  To see the dead-end on that road you need the ability to think in principles and only a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism">passing</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism">familiarity</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union">with</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Germany">history</a>.</p>
