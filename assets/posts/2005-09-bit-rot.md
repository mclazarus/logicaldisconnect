  <p>Amazing how some technology left out Friday after confirming it works,  heck it had been working the same way since July.  Seems to grow fungus or mold, or simply atrophy and no longer work after the weekend is over.
Like making [JBoss](http://www.jboss.org/) talk to [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) luckily trial and error correction is made nearly impossible because it takes a good 10 minutes for each round trip on the cycle. :-(</p>
