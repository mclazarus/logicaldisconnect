<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p><a href="http://www.lafitness.com/">LA Fitness</a> opened a new club in <a href="http://lafitness.com/app/club/club?clubId=102&amp;flow=0">Fort Washington</a> which turns out to be 1.7 mi. from my house.  Which seems to take about 3 minutes to travel to and from at 5 AM and 6:15 AM respectively.
This makes me happy.</p>
<p>I believe it opened yesterday, it is nice, it's one that has the upper level for the aerobic stuff, which is cool to be able to look out over the club while you are running, however it is a bad design because of the fact that hot air ends up where the people are in the most need of cool air.  Plus now-a-days the heater tends to be on, and that is where the ducts are blowing on you.  But it's only a mild discomfort, much better than running in the torrential rain that was going on this morning.</p>
<p>Anyway I was the only one working out there from about 5:01 AM - until about 5:25 when another guy showed up.  That was great.  I left about 6:15 and am now quite excited to be able to get back into my old 5AM routine.</p>
