<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Well despite my best efforts, the Eagles didn't win the SuperBowl this year.  Congratulations to the Birds for another excellent season.  But like every fan, and gamer addicted to Madden Franchise mode, I have my suggestions for offseason talent aquisition priorities.</p>
<ol>
<li>Wide Reciever</li>
<li>Solid Linebacker (Dawkins can't make every tackle)</li>
<li>Running Back (Duce and Buck are both Free Agents)</li>
<li>Corner Back</li>
</ol>
<p>Probably a bunch of other stuff..</p>
<p>But thanks for an exciting season.</p>
