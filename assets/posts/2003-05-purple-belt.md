<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I progressed to Purple belt.  Now I finally get to learn a new form, well one that is the same footwork as 1 Pinon, but invovles different strikes, when doing this new form I am supposed to learn more about advanced push-pull.</p>
<p>I also get to learn two more Kempos and Combination number 4.  (There are 108 combinations in the system).</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and I can buy and wear a black <a href="http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=923008">gi</a> now, if I want.</p>
