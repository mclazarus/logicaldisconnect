<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>A friend of mine recently released a gmail notify applet for Linux.  [gmnotify](http://gmnotify.sourceforge.net/) from what I can tell it is pretty sweet compared to some of the alternatives.  Go ahead and check it out.  That is if you use gmail and want little windows popping up telling you that you got an email.</p>
