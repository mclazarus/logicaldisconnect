<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I have begun the process of moving all of my stuff to a new web hosting provider.  To <em>ease</em> the transition, I decided to also switch from <a href="http://movabletype.org/" shape="rect">MovableType</a> to <a href="http://wordpress.org/" shape="rect">WordPress</a>.  Installing wordpress was easy, and importing my entries was easy.  The hard part will be trying to make it so my old broken permalinks are still valid here, and I may simply have to give up on that.  But hopefully the flexible format for the permalinks I have used here will allow me to make it last.  Next I need to get my gallery and email moved.</p>
