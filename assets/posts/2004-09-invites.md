<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Hey, I have a few <a href="http://gmail.google.com/">GMail</a> invites for anyone that is interested.  Just post a comment and I'll send you one.
<strong>Update:</strong> Well I sent one out, and I got a good suggestion in the comments, so I am just going to use: <a href="http://isnoop.net/gmailomatic.php">the isnoop.net GMail invite spooler</a> for these and any future invites I get.</p>
