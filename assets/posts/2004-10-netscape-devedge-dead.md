<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/docs/web-developer/">Netscape's DevEdge</a> appears to be dead, which is unfortunate because it was my only saving grace when it came to screwign around with javascript.  So I looked at <a href="http://archive.org/">the wayback machine</a> and did some other googling to find the zip files for the <a href="http://mcallister.ws/useful/CoreReferenceJS15.zip">Core JavaScript Reference</a> and <a href="http://mcallister.ws/useful/CoreGuideJS15.zip">Core JavaScript Guide</a> and stuck them on my server.  So I would have somewhere to get to them in the future.
Hopefully the Mozilla folks who maintain the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/docs/web-developer/">web developer documentation</a> will snag this stuff and put it up somewhere on their own server.</p>
