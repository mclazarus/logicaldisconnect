<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>When you are a bank that bills yourself as "convenient" it is best if your customers aren't telling stories like this:
"but I told them they better do whatever they have to do to get me a card in the next 10 minutes or I'm leaving with my card & all my money...that was the only thing that got thier attention"</p>
