<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Through my new interest in keeping a weblog journal, I couldn't help but spout off about it to a few friends.   Well it seems I may have given a final nudge to a couple of them onto the blogging scene.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.webcodefocus.com/" title="Mike's Blog">Mike King</a> also just launched his and personally credits me for some of his decision.</p>
<p>Also <a href="http://www.deadmime.org/~dank/about.html" title="Personnel Identification Area">Dan Kalowsky</a>, who does a lot of work on <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> among other things, recently lauched his weblog too.  I think he was already decided to launch one but was not sure which tool to use, I shared some of my initial experience with <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">MovableType</a> and he followed into the fold with his weblog titled <a href="http://www.deadmime.org/~dank/blog/">bacon grease drippings</a>.</p>
<p>Now they will be added into my ever growing blogroll, and hopefully we can all benefit from <a href="http://www.chaosreigns.com/" title="Welcome to my sweet oblivion">Darxus'</a> <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/entry/google-juice.html">Google Juice</a>.</p>
