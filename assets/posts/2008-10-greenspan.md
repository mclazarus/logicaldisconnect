<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Today [Alan Greenspan stated](http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSTRE49M58W20081023), "Those of us who have looked to the self-interest of lending institutions to protect shareholder's equity (myself especially) are in a state of shocked disbelief."
He's shocked?  That's surprising.  He, himself, wrote about the result of government intervention in the economy, in [Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal](http://www.amazon.com/Capitalism-Ideal-Ayn-Rand/dp/0451147952/mclazarus-20/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1224778300&sr=8-1).  Maybe he should pick up a copy and try and understand his role in the destruction.</p>
