<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I finally got around to un-abandoning my [livejournal](http://www.livejournal.com/users/mclazarus/).  I decided to grab the latest version of [Live+Press](http://somuchgeek.com/code/livepress/) and try it out.
P.S. If the links in LJ are all busted it's because I got used to writing with [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) turned on in wordpress.  It may be yet another hurdle that needs to be overcome.  Or I can go back to writing out HTML longhand like a caveman.</p>
<p>**Update**: Hacked up the live+press sync code to run it through markdown first.  *crossing fingers*. </p>
