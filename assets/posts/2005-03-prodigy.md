My daughter rules!  Yesterday as a belated birthday present she rolled over last night after dinner.  Apparently she was practicing this trick all day while I was at work, and waited until I got home to finally pull it off.  I was and continue to be not only amazed, but also proud and outwardly aloof like I expected it all the time.  Of course my little girl can do things better and faster than everyone else ;-)</p>
<p>Anyway, It was not a one time fluke either, reports out of Montgomery County are just in saying the feat was repeated this morning, with authority.  There are a bunch of short but very large AVIs of her trying to roll over, on the increasingly growing <a href="http://mcallister.ws/gallery/allison">gallery</a>, the snapshot here is from one of her initial attempts.</p>
