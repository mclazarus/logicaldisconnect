<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>My current bout with some upper respiratory virus has helped me learn that asthma probably is really not good to have.  For some reason my body responded to this infection by inflaming the airway and packing my lungs with mucus.</p>
<p>But I felt like I had an iron band around my chest for 2 days.</p>
<p>
The good news is my doctor gave me some medicine that should help me avoid iron band syndrome until the virus is done with me.</p>
