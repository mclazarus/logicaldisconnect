  <p>Well it looks like Dell is <em>finally</em> going to make good on my service contract.  Apparently their part backorder problems are resolved, and I just heard from Jeff the service technician who should be here in about 45 minutes.</p>
<p>Now I can get back to working at 1400x1050 and in Linux.  The backup laptop I was using was only capable of 800x600 under Linux, and 1024x768 under <a href="http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=56302">wintendo</a></p>
<p>Now if only I could run M$ Project under <a href="http://codeweavers.com/">Codeweavers</a> <a href="http://codeweavers.com/products/office/">Crossover Office</a>.</p>
