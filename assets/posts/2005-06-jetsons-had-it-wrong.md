<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>by the way, I just read Eric Sink's <a href="http://software.ericsink.com/entries/airport_madness.html">Entry on staying out of his way at the airport</a>.  And I couldn't agree more.  Although he did forget one critical thing.  Those moving sidewals, like the Jetson's had, <strong>are not a RIDE!</strong>.  It even says above them, "Express walkway" and not express <em>standway</em>.
Sure I understand certain people could use a break in the day to just cruise at 1.5 MPH as the facinating artwork and other dumb airport stuff goes by.  But please pull your seven suitcases and your grandparents off to one side, so people can walk past.</p>
