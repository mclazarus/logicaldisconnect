<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>The new SpamAssassin is out!</p>
<p>I installed it and ran a quick test... and a spam that made it through yesterday, got squashed with the new version.  It also sleekly sports support for <a title="A Plan for Spam" href="http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html">Bayesian filtering</a>.</p>
