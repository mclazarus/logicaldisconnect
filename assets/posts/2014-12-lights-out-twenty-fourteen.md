<p>I'd have liked to put a nice highlight reel together for 2014 and talk about my big plans for 2015. I've had plenty of highlights and I have plenty of big plans but I didn't take the time to examine them and write it out.</p>

<p>The last year especially has felt extremely hectic at times and I think one of the things I'll focus on in the beginning of 2015 is trying to minimize that.  To drop the comfort of busy and be even more ruthless in my priorities. And finally to regularly reflect on how things are going.</p>

<p>I've had a great twenty fourteen.  Twenty fifteen will be great too.</p>

<p>Lights out!</p>
