  <blockquote><p>It has long been an article of our folklore that too much knowledge or skill, or especially consummate expertise, is a bad thing.  It dehumanizes those who achieve it, and makes difficult their commerce with just plain folks, in whom good old common sense has not been obliterated by mere book learning or fancy notions.  This popular delusion flourishes now more than ever, for we are all infected with it in the schools, where educationists have elevated it from folklore to Article of Belief.  It enhances their self-esteem and lightens their labors by providing theoretical justification for deciding that appreciation, or even simple awareness, is more to be prized than knowledge, and relating (to self and others), more than skill, in which minimum competence will be quite enough.</p>

<p>I wonder if this observation is generally true.  And what cultures it applies to.</p>
