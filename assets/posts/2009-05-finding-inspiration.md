  <p>Becoming depressed by the increased destruction of individual rights by the government is quite easy these days.  The fact that the current administration is <a href="http://zerohedge.blogspot.com/2009/05/cliff-asness-i-am-ready-for-my.html">violating contract rights</a>, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/03/30/obama.autos/index.html">firing the CEO of a corporation</a>, and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/14/AR2009051401425.html">forcing banks to take bailout money</a> among many other examples of statism are all very ominous indeed.
To continue this trend, today, I received an email from <a href="http://casey.senate.gov/">Senator Casey</a> singing his own praises for his role in the further <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/A-New-Era-for-Credit-Cards/">meddling with the credit markets</a>.  </p>
<p>As is typical when I receive such self-glorying proclamations from my elected representatives I take a moment and compose a letter responding to them and encouraging them to uphold <a href="http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=arc_ayn_rand_man_rights">individual rights</a> as an absolute as is the necessary and only purpose of a <a href="http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=arc_ayn_rand_the_nature_of_government">rational and moral government</a>.</p>
<p>I began writing my response somewhat lethargically but when I organized my thoughts it brought to mind a particular passage from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Atlas-Shrugged-Centennial-Ed-HC/dp/0525948929/mclazarus-20/">Atlas Shrugged</a> which provided the fuel to complete task.  I decided then to look it up and to share it here.</p>
<blockquote><p>I could say to you that you do not serve the public good--that nobody's good can be achieved at the price of human sacrifices--that when you violate the rights of one man, you have violated the rights of all, and a public of rightless creatures is doomed to destruction.  I could say to you that you will and can achieve nothing but universal devastation--as any looter must, when he runs out of victims.  I could say it, but I won't.  It is not your particular policy that I challenge, but your moral premise.  If it were true that men could achieve their good by means of turning some men into sacrificial animals, and I were asked to immolate myself for the sake of creatures who wanted to survive at the price of my blood, if I were asked to serve the interests of society apart from, above and against my own--I would refuse, I would reject it as the most contemptible evil, I would fight it with every power I possess, I would fight the whole of mankind, if one minute were all I could last before I were murdered, I would fight in the full confidence of the justice of my battle and of a living being's right to exist.  Let there be no misunderstanding about me.  If it is now the belief of my fellow men, who call themselves the public, that their good requires victims, then I say: The public good be damned, I will have no part of it!</p></blockquote>
