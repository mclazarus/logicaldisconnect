<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I am now the owner of a license to run <a href="http://www.codeweavers.com/products/office/">CrossOver Office 2.0</a>, and am currently installing MS Office 2000 under RedHat Linux 9.  So far it is going very well, and I will be happy to not reboot in order to collaborate on co-workers documents or to convert my work into MSWord format.</p>
<p>Also MSWord takes a lot of kicking around from myself included, but it is not terribly difficult to get it to do what you want.  I think working with Knuth's <a href="http://www.tug.org/">TeX</a>, <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>, and <a href="http://texinfo.org">GNU texinfo</a>, have helped me to better understand what goes into document formatting and therefore be more effective in using MSWord when I need to format my documents.  But give me emacs and people who can read plain (extremely portable) text files any day.</p>
<p>My favorite part of the CrossOver install is captured in this image.</p>
