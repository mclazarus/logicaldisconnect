<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Since the election talk is on the minds of many and there is so much focus on the office of the President, everyone please make sure and do <a href="http://vote-smart.org/">a little research</a> on the other important governmental offices.
I had a conversation with <a href="http://webcodefocus.com">Mike</a> about which office on the upcoming ballot is the most important to an individual, his argument succinctly stated is "Your representatives in the U.S. House and Senate are exactly that, your direct representatives."  It is important to try and understand all the offices and questions you may have on your ballot.  So go to <a href="http://vote-smart.org/">vote-smart.org</a> find out who is on your ballot and do enough research to help you make a decision.</p>
