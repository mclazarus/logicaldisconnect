<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>The ability to extend software is awesome.  This is evident by all the great extensions to Firefox.  But I was just sent one of the best extensions I have seen so far.  <a href="http://www.karmatics.com/aardvark/">Aardvark</a>.  It is great for removing crap from a page prior to printing or examining a page for web development work.
Download and enjoy.  If you don't use <a href="http://getfirefox.com/">Firefox</a> as your browser, then what the heck are you waiting for?  IE is trash.</p>
