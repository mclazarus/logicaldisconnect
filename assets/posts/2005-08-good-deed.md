<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I did my good deed for the year.  I primarily saved some big faceless credit card company some money, but I did save some poor schlub some hassle, and I have learned from a wise man, the quest to be hassle-free is divine.
Well I was out on my habitual morning walk.  After having fended of a psudo-attack from a stupid dog, I spotted a Discover card on the ground.  I scooped it up, and when I got home called Discover and told them I found someone else's card.  The Discover employee was not quite flabergasted, but he was surprised.  So I destroyed the card and Discover will be contacting their cardholder.</p>
<p>You're welcome Mr. Slacum.</p>
