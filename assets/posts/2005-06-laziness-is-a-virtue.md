<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Again and again I come to this conclusion.  The lazy man is way more efficient, and works on interesting things rather than repetitive dumb things.  For a very good discussion on this go to a library or a book store and grab a copy of <em>Time Enough for Love</em> by Robert Heinlein and find the story in there about "The Man who was too lazy to fail."
I'd tell you more about it, but I am feeling a bit put out by the effort.</p>
