  <p>Apparently it is broken computer season, I have had several family members dutifully report their computer problems to me over the past two weeks.  Let's hope we have reached the limit, I can't take the excitement of many more of these.</p>
<p>Also maybe it's a coincidence but 2 of them were my Mom and my brother and both of their issues are already fixed, the other two are Michelle's Aunt and her Mom.  And those issues are still broken.  Actually her aunt had the misfortune of calling me on Fantasy draft weekend, and I just heard about my Mother-in-Law's today.</p>
<p>
Hopefully I can work on getting out of much more of this type of repair.  Maybe if these folks got a look at my sad slow and non-booting computers at home they would be reluctant to call me at all.</p>
