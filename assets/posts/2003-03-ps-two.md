<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>My parents got me <a href="http://www.us.playstation.com/hardware/ps2/">PS2</a> for my fast approaching birthday.  (March 7th)!  I wasn't sure if I wanted one for a while, because I was worried it would sit unplayed, since I am usually rather busy, between <a href="http://www.centraview.com/">work</a>, <a href="http://www.lafitness.com">the gym</a>, <a href="http://www.kickboxingcentral.com">karate</a>, my general thirst to increase my knowledge, and most importantly, spending time with Michelle, I am usually rather short on down time.</p>
<p>But I have already spent a few hours playing, and am glad to get back in the console scene.  And the simple distraction factor is always welcome, I find it a few minutes fully committed to playing a game helps me focus more thouroughly on my work later.</p>
