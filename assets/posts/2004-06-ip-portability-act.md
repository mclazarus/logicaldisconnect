  <p>The courts are trying to break the Internet.  There has been a temporary restraining order issued in a state court allowing a customer to take a non-portable IP address with them when they leave.  Read about the insanity <a href="http://www.merit.edu/mail.archives/nanog/msg05815.html" shape="rect">here</a>.  This would be a bad thing for service providers if the precedent is set.  And provides no measurable gain for consumers.  I mean DNS sort of solved whatever problem the petitioner seeks to rectify by keeping their IP address.
Frankly I am of the opinion that telephone number portability is stupid as well.  I barely remember phone numbers any more, my cell phone has made that practice obsolete.</p>
