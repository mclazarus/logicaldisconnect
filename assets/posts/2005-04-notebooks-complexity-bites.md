<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>well as predicted my decision to use extra complexity is causing me problems, Now the front page of Logical Disconnect is blank, because I am only showing the last 10 posts or so, of course all of the last 10 posts are in the Notebooks category, so I am skipping displaying them on the front page.
I guess I will have to fix that at some point.</p>
