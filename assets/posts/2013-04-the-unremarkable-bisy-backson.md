<p>I don't think this is a great article, <a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/2013/04/03/you-can-be-busy-or-remarkable-but-not-both/">You Can Be Busy or Remarkable—But Not Both</a>.  But when I read it—after a tremendously busy day—it struck a chord.  Plus I couldn't resist a title reference to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tao-Pooh-Piglet-Boxed-Set/dp/014095144X/logicaldiscon-20">Tao of Pooh</a> after seeing the guy referenced in the article was some dude named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Tao">Tao</a>.</p>

<p>I read something that said <em>being lost</em> is not about not knowing where you are, but giving too much focus and anxiety to where you are not.  I don't have any idea what the origin of this was, maybe some quote in my High School yearbook.  </p>

<p>I think often the sense of anxiety that accompanies being busy is about knowing all the things you aren't doing and letting that fill up your mind.  Or allowing your mind-reading of other people's expectations to dictate how you feel about your life.  These things all are awful ideas.</p>

<p>Anyway I'm feeling a inspired to spend a more of of my time trying to relax, be realistic, and have some fun.</p>

<p><em>Update: I read what I wrote and was completely confused, so I reworded some things.  See I was tremendously busy yesterday and my brain doesn't work anymore.</em></p>
