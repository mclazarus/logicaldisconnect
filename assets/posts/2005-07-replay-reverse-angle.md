<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Got the replay up and running, I simply downloaded <a href="http://rtvpatch.sourceforge.net/">rtvpatch</a>, an image from <a href="http://www.replaytvupgrade.com/#obtainimagefiles">replay images</a> and shot over to <a href="http://www.microcenter.com/">microcenter</a> to buy a disk got a deal on a Western Digital 160GB for $60 after manufacturer and store rebate ($120 without) and after screwing around with the master/slave/cable select settings got it to boot up and I am back in business with a good 70 hours or so of record time at medium quality.
The only problem I currently live with is that the remote doesn't control the television also.  I guess I could invest in a good universal remote that will control the TV and the Replay.  Anyone have any success with any really good universals or do they still all mostly suck?  I know my experience was that they work, except for one or two annoyances that you live with but hate.  Like if you hit the channel up button 5 consecutive times it puts the tv in its special channel scan mode that flips through the channels once every 3 seconds or so, at least that is what happens with my bedroom television that I never turn on.</p>
