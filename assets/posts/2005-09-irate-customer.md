<p>This is one of the funniest clips I ever heard, I don't remember how I got my hands on it.  I think one of my co-workers at ASPRE sent it to me, or maybe a former co-worker from Northrop Grumman. I have no idea who the caller is, or what company they are calling, but every time I listen to it I really crack up. Now this is not worksafe, well I guess that depends on where you work, but it's basically a guy screaming language that is not commonly acceptable.</p>
