<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>My father told me that on the night I was born he read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?tag=logicaldiscon-20&location=/exec/obidos/ASIN/0441788386%3FSubscriptionId=048656PF073H3HPEQ4G2" title="View product details at Amazon">Stranger in a Strange Land</a> in its entirety.  So no I don't know if tonight is the night, but I also don't think I can read as fast as my Dad, so I am trying to get a head start.  Plus, its a thick book.
Yes of course I have read it before, actually twice or three times, but it was good, and I figure I should work on continuing the tradition, or maybe I am the one starting it since I am doing it the second time, but either way I finished Metamorphisis yesterday, and I had just started <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/8438">Aristotle's Ethics</a>, but decided do everything I can to help get the kid born since the 5th is fast approaching, and Michelle really, really would like it to happen as soon as possible.</p>
