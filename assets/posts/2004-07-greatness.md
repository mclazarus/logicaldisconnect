  <p><span>Yet another thought provoking article from <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/" shape="rect" title="Paul Graham's website">Paul Graham</a>: <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/gh.html" shape="rect" title="Article on Great Hackers">Great Hackers</a>.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>
<span>I've found that people who are great at something are not so much convinced of their own greatness as mystified at why everyone else seems so incompetent. The people I've met who do great work rarely think that they're doing great work. They generally feel that they're stupid and lazy, that their brain only works properly one day out of ten, and that it's only a matter of time until they're found out.</span>

Yeah, I know anyone who reads my blog already saw this somewhere else, or doesn't really care to read it.  Well I want to be able to find it again.  And I haven't found a good way to do bookmark sharing between many different machines.  Maybe a good idea for a firefox plugin.</span></p>
