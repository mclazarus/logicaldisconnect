<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>one of the <em>advantages</em> of working in a swamp in New Jersey is that there are plenty of geese around.  I like to walk around at lunch time just to get some outside time, and geese like to be jerks.  So the showdown was inevitable.
Anyway, yesterday one of the geese was bobbing it's head and hissing at me as I approached, it came toward me a little aggressively.  Now I can't possibly run from a goose.  <em>can I?</em>  So I stopped and raised my arms out to the side to appear bigger to the goose.  It stopped.  Then I made an aggressive move toward it, stomping my foot, and it moved away.</p>
<p>Today on my walk I think I saw the same goose.  At least it was in the same area.  It hissed at me again but kept its distance.</p>
