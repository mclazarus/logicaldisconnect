  <p>Well I am joining the ranks of people who have a way too expensive toy.  I had a good experience listening to an audio book during my commute, so I took some birthday money, money saved from cancelling my Investors Business Daily subscription and the offer from <a href="http://www.audible.com/">audible.com</a> to get $100 toward an audio player for signing up for a 1 year subscription, and got the best deal I could find.
I grabbed the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodphoto/">iPod photo</a> 40 GB which is discontinued, but is currently available through amazon for $360.00 which is of course only $11 more than the 30 GB iPod photo.  And the 40 actually comes with a few more accessories (AV cables most notably).  Sure it's slightly bigger (0.12 inches thicker and 0.5 ounces heavier) but I think I can deal with that.  You can make the purchase even more inexpensive for me, by buying one yoruself using my referral code: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002ZAEX6/logicaldiscon-20">iPod photo 40</a>.  Now I won't have to try and carry wallet photos around either.  I also got the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00019068G/logicaldiscon-20/102-1321608-0276144">Monster Cable iCarPlay iPod Wireless FM Transmitter</a> so I can listen in my car, which is the whole point.</p>
<p>Hopefully it will be arriving in time for me to spend a long weekend playing with it.  Excitement abounds.</p>
