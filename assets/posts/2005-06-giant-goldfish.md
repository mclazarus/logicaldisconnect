<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Here is a list of things I saw or noticed during my trip so far:
<ul>
<li>cat sized goldfish in the hotel lobby</li>
<li>An outdoor mall, that has one indoor part for their food court, and also an ice hockey rink</li>
<li>A crappy fitness center that is open from 6 AM PDT - Midnight PDT making it fairly useless for my morning workout <em>just leave it open all night!</em></li>
<li>Hitch, although I purposely didn't watch it on the long flight.  Instead I read about 300 or 400 pages</li>
<li>The Knife King</li>
<li>dippin dots</li>
</ul>
<p>Now to go do some work.  By the way travel sucks, luckily my return flight leaves San Diego around midnight eastern time and gets into PHL around 5 AM.  Here's hoping for a window seat in an exit row.</p>
