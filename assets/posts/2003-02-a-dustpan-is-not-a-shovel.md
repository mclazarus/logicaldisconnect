      I finally realized first hand why I might need a shovel when living in 
      an apartment.

        The maintenance here generally is subpar

        It snowed approximately 2 feet last night

      Anyway, I attempted at noon to dig out our cars, after 30 minutes I had 
      broken my dustpan and my broom. I managed to clear a good deal of snow 
      off the cars, but there was still 2 feet of snow around and in front of 
      the cars. And I was disgusted.

      Luckily when I went out to beg for a shovel, around 6:00 PM, a neighbor, 
      Keith, was kind enough to lend me one and help me dig out the cars. He 
      then went out of his way to help me shovel out the cars. This encourages 
      me to make an effort to talk to my neighbors more often.
