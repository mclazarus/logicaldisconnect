  <p><a herf="http://43folders.com/">Merlin Mann</a> a vocal proponent of David Allen's <em>Getting Things Done</em> wrote some good advice on business email use: <a href="http://www.macworld.com/2005/04/features/tipsinbox/index.php">email howto</a> a piece of it that is tailor made for me is:</p>
<blockquote><p>Keep It Short</p>
<p>Finally, when you do respond to your mail, keep your answers as concise as possible. Donât sit on old mail because you dread crafting a long response. Just keep the ball in motion by clarifying, asking questions, offering help, or even saying âI donât know.â? You can always write more later.</p></blockquote>
