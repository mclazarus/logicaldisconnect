<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>The continued snowing is vexing me in my commute and in my desire to not shovel.  Luckily one of my neighbors has been using his snow thrower early and often, and over a good portion of my property.  So thanks for the hand, Ray.  I know you will probably never see this, but hopefully your daughter gave you the cookies my wife baked for you after the 2 feet we got a little while back.
I left early today to hopefully keep my work to driving ratio high.  And if it keeps snowing all night, I may be sitting in my living room working tomorrow.  A guy could get used to working from his recliner.  If only this laptop didn't get so hot.</p>
