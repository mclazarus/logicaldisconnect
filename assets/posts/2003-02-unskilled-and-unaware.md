<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p><a href="http://www.deadmime.org/~dank/archives/2003/02/26/End%20users%20continued.html">Dan</a> has brought an interesting article to my attention: <a href="http://www.apa.org/journals/psp/psp7761121.html">Unskilled and Unaware of it</a>.  This article is great!  Granted, I have only read the Abstract, but it gets my seal of approval (thus far).</p>
<p>I know a list of people who are essentially described within the article, unfortunately the point (and even the point of my sending it) would be entirely lost on them.</p>
