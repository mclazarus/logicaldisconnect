  <p>Which character are you from the Matrix?  Apperently I am Agent Smith.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.quizilla.com/T/trinitykills/1052781976_agentsmith.jpg" border="0" alt="You are Agent Smith" /><br />You are Agent Smith, from "The Matrix."<br />No one would ever want to run into you in a<br />dark alley. Cold as steel, tough as a rock,<br />things are your way or the highway.<br /><a href="http://quizilla.com/users/trinitykills/quizzes/What%20Matrix%20Persona%20Are%20You%3F/"> What Matrix Persona Are You?</a></p>
<p>Saw the <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0234215" title="The Matrix Reloaded">flick</a> on Saturday, going at noon on the next week after release is the way to miss the crowds and not be packed into a little theatre.  But I liked it, basically I was going for the <a href="http://www.snpp.com/episodes/3F08.html">big noises and shiny things</a>, so I certainly got that.  But I also saw some of the effect of having a huger budget to make this movie.  There were scenes in there that were meant to spend budget rather than tell story.  But all in all I enjoyed it, and the martial arts were pretty cool to watch, specifically because most of it was made up of basic strikes and kicks that I have already learned in my <a href="http://www.kickboxingcentral.net">Karate</a> studies, so I could enjoy the perspective that if I was about 100 times faster and not subject to the laws of physics I could do the same amount of damage.  But for a more in depth negative review, you can see <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/5/15/22352/6060" title="Matrix Reloaded Reviewed">Matrix Reloaded Reviewed</a>.</p>
