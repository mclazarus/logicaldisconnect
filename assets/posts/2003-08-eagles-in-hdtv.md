  <p><q>But this is HDTV. It's got better resolution than the real world.</q> -Fry (<a href="http://www.fox.com/futurama/">Futurama</a>)
The Eagles won their opening <a href="http://nfl.com/gamecenter/live/NFL_20030811_PHI@NO">game</a> of the "for fake" season.  And I watched it at Dave's in <acronym title="High Definition Television">HDTV</acronym>.  It is extremely crisp and a very good picture that does make quite a difference in the viewing experience, however it certainly is not worth more than $500 to me, at least at this point in my financial history.  But if given the opportunity, I will try and catch more high definition games.  I imagine it is really great for watching ice hockey.</p>
<p>By the way, the Eagles are going to be awesome again because of the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Offensive line is very, very good</li>
<li>Donovan McNabb</li>
<li>The defensive backs are probably the best group out there</li>
<li>They have 3 really good defensive tackles, Darwin Walker, Corey Simon, and Hollis Thomas (who looked very quick.)</li>
<li>The recieving core is deeper, more talented, and more confident than a year ago when they played well</li>
<li>Ritchie is a bad-ass</li>
<li>Many other reasons that will become evident as the season progresses</li>
</ul>
