<p>I posted a while ago about <a href="http://logicaldisconnect.org/blog/2014/10/ruthless-39-of-90">my current health kick</a>.  I successfully finished 90 days on Sunday.  </p>

<p>I noticed partway through that there were some slight issues.  I think I was doing too much gym leading to a flare up of plantar fasciitis and there were a few days where I needed a break.  Finally I have a tendancy to backslide into eating sugary snacks after sustained exercise routines, rationalizing that I've earned it.</p>

<p>I decided to take a week off from the gym to let me recover a bit and refocus on the non-snacking since it undermines my primary goal.</p>

<p>The primary number: I lost 31 lbs.  Down from 254 lbs to 223.  This is basically my pre-marriage, pre-child weight back when I was studying Kempo after losing about 80 lbs between 11/2001 - 5/2002.</p>

<p>I'm going to take 5-7 days off from the gym and then get back to work.  My goal is to get to 190 lbs and emboldened by my recent success, I think I can do it by my birthday.</p>

<p>I'd put in a count of gym visits but <a href="http://lift.do">Lift</a> appears to be down, but as a guess I think I went to the gym about 75 out of 90 days.  Probably too much, but it pumps me full of energy and I enjoy it.</p>
