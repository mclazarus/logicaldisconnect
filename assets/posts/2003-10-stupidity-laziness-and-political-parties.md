  <p>With it being presidential election season, and with the circus that was the California Govenor recall.  And the fact that I started listening to <a href="http://www.npr.org/">NPR</a>, I have heard quite a bit of political discussion.  And the thing that I can't understand at all is the deep rooted belief in some people that they always need to vote for whatever candidate their party trots out in front of them.  The don't care if its the best person for the job, just as long as its a Democrat or Republican.
I hear things like "We need to pick a candidate with the best chance of beating George Bush and getting a Democrat into the whitehouse."  What the hell.  How about we need to pick a candidate with the best chance of doing the Chief Executive's job well.  The only rationalization I can come up with is lazieness, I mean I am as lazy as the next guy, and can understand they have chosen a group of people that best represent their thoughts on politics and instead of understanding the issues in great detail.  I mean its the reason you hire an expert to fix your car or do your electrician work, because you don't know how it all works and you really don't want to know.  </p>
<p>But is suffrage really something to make this trade off with.  People have and are currently dying for the right to vote, the right to have a say in the way their country is run.  If you are going to vote, it is your responsibility to understand for who and for what.  So take a minute to try and understand if someone may be right to run the country, don't just vote republican because your dad did and so did his dad, and that is just the way it is.  Stop voting in the lizards.</p>
