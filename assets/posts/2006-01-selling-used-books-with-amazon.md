  <p>I have had a pretty good experience seeling with Amazon.  But I never really paid attention to the selling fee structure, because I was happy to just make a few bucks on most of my books.  But on friday I got the notice that another of my books sold.  I charged $2.50, I got paid for standard shipping.  But the Amazon fee came out to be $2.60.
Well, shit, I ain't about giving my books away and paying for the privilege.  I would rather burn it than pay Amazon 10 cents for the privilege of shipping it to someone else.  I looked into it, and yes of course I am in the wrong.  I mean they have it all laid out.  They take 99 cents and then some %age of the sale, and then some closing cost.  Which is purposely confusing so that you will sign up to pay them a monthly fee to sell with some advanced account, so you can waive some of those fees.  </p>
<p>Fine I get it they want to make money.  But damn, I only have maybe a grand total of 20 books I want to sell in a year, and that is on the high end.  So clearly half.com is the answer for me.  (they just charge a %age of the sale)</p>
<p>But just a reminder to myself, don't list for under $3 with amazon.  And probably don't list with Amazon any more.</p>
