<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>My brother wrote an article for his website a few months back basically saying steroid use is not a huge problem in the NFL <a href="http://tom.mcallister.ws/2005/04/04/why-steroids-are-not-an-issue-in-the-nfl-unless-you-count-ed-hochuli/">Why Steroids Are Not an Issue in the NFL (Unless You Count Ed Hochuli)</a> As you can see he used the name of the very muscular Ed Hochuli as a joke in the title.  Well someone claiming to be Ed Hochuli just <a href="http://tom.mcallister.ws/2005/04/04/why-steroids-are-not-an-issue-in-the-nfl-unless-you-count-ed-hochuli#comment-664">struck back in the comments section</a>.  It certainly looks like a fake, but the email address used to post actually was Ed Hochuli's (very easy to find) and the IP address the post came from seems to be from a cable modem subscriber in Phoenix which is where Super Ed's law firm is located.
So the simple fact of the matter is, Ed Hochuli, is reading my brother's website.  Or at least the titles of the articles.</p>
