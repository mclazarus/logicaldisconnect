  <p>I wrote a while ago about <a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/500c727de4b0d820d6a42ad8/515f5893e4b0f7bed43ad1d5/515f59bbe4b0f7bed43ae73c/1365203387637/000039.html?format=original">Letting the smoke out</a>.  Just wanted to give an update.  I purchased an <a href="http://antec-inc.com/pro_details_powerSupply.php?ProdID=20550">Antec True550</a> from CompUSA that same morning.  Yeah 550 watts may have been overkill for what I had, but it certainly wouldn't be as underwhelming as its predecessor was.  And Sherlock is humming along as it should.</p>
<p>Luckily there appears to be no collateral damage from the <q>War of smoke containment.</q>  This upgrade of power supply has cleared up a few of the idiosyncrasies that I have experienced with this system over the time I have been using it.  So, lesson learned, the power is the lifeblood of the computer.  So don't skimp on the powersupply just because it will come packaged with your really cool case.</p>
