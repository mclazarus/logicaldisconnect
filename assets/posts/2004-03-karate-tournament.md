<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>The <a href="http://www.villari.com/">Villari's</a> regional tournament is tomorrow.  I am excited to compete for the first time.  I will be representing the <a href="http://kickboxingcentral.com/">Trevose studio</a>, and hopefully I will make a good showing.  I am competing in Forms, Point Sparring and Self Defense.
Also congratulations to the Trevose Head Instructor Jim Wing, on achieving his fourth degree black belt.  I think this officially acknowledges his ability to beat me up while expending no energy at all.</p>
