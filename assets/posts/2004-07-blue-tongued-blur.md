  <p><img height="180" style="float: left; margin: 1em;" alt="blue-tongued 2 year old" width="240" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/500c727de4b0d820d6a42ad8/515f5893e4b0f7bed43ad1d5/515f59bde4b0f7bed43ae767/1365203389292/blue-tongue.jpg?format=original"/>Here you can see a picture of the nearly 2 years old, wild blue-tongued blur, who was on a doggie kisses rampage.

<p>Happy Birthday, Madison.</p>
