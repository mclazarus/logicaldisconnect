  <p>After seeing lots of information from [smart people](http://www.dianahsieh.com/blog/index.shtml).  I decided to challenge some nutritional ideas I had implicitly accepted.  One major step on that road was reading [Good Calories, Bad Calories](http://www.amazon.com/Good-Calories-Bad-Controversial-Science/dp/1400033462/mclazarus-20/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1232129587&sr=1-1) by Gary Taubes.  He does an excellent job exploring the evidence and reasons behind the idea that saturated fat leads to heart disease.  He also puts forth a compelling argument against the use of refined carbohydrates in the diet.
Based on my research I have decided to refine my eating habits and have decided the following general rules.</p>
<p> * When in doubt eat meat (*BACON!*) and vegetables, protein and fat are good.
 * Make a special effort to eat high quality food. [^1]
 * Avoid Refined carbs (sugar, grain, tastycakes, Pez, ColdStone)
 * Avoid most vegetable oils (olive oil is good stuff)
 * Mostly avoid artificial sweeteners (I had been consuming quite a bit daily)</p>
<p>These "rules" came out of research and out of experimentation that started in late September of 2008.  The first observation that came from avoiding refined carbs was to avoid the energy roller coaster.  Although this term doesn't quite capture the feeling I had.  I had never felt like I have had too much energy, the extremes I felt were enough energy to survive, and I can't keep my head up.  After a few painful days at the outset where I dealt with headaches and a general feeling of disorientation, I have noticed a good general level of energy all of the time.  I have run many experiments and spent time finding foods I enjoy, and seeing the effect on my mood, energy level, and stomach.  This was the time I came up with those rules.  And then I decided to apply them rigorously in 2009 starting on the 5th.</p>
<p>The most noteworthy result is in that time I have lost 6 lbs, have been to the gym once, and have eaten as much as I wanted.  This can't be overstated.  I am experienced at [weightloss](http://mcallister.ws/weightloss.html) and I have never lost any without feeling hungry and dissatisfied at the end of most of my meals, having frequent headaches and suffering through frequent boring repetitive workouts.  </p>
<p>I have noted a few other immediate benefits as well.  I have discovered a whole host of foods I really enjoy.  I have saved some money by packing my lunch more frequently than usual.  I have surprisingly and quickly reached a point where I don't have the emotional desire to eat sugary foods.  And best of all, I feel good, and I can see that I will start to feel even better when I get my workout integrated into my routine.</p>
<p>[^1]: I'll give links and explanation of what high quality food is, in a future post.  For now you can satisfy yourself with the idea that it is less processed, less chemically treated.</p>
