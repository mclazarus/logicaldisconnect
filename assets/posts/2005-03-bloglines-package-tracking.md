<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Cool, bloglines does package tracking now: <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/about/news">Bloglines News</a>.
I guess this is cool if you use your notifier.  Otherwise when I am expecting a package I reload the tracker page on the shippers site like 100 times an hour, but someone else may enjoy it.</p>
