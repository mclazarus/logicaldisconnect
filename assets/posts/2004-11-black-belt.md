Today I am sore, tired and completly satisfied.  Yesterday was the black belt test, and I came to a waypoint on a long journey that started two years ago when I <strong>earned</strong> my black belt at <a href="http://kickboxingcentral.com/">Wing's Martial Arts Academy</a>.  It was a great experience, and I am better for having accomplished this.  Today I feel like I can accomplish anything.  </p>
