I am glad to see that riddle # 3 had a few people missed it.  Not that I take delight that someone got it wrong, rather that it wasn't a very easy one.  It is fraught with misdirection, the obvious guess is a promise or something along those lines, but oddly that is too deep of a thought the correct answer is "Silence."</p>

Of course my wife already knew that one again, but let's see if she has an answer for this one.</p>
