<p>I've been rushed lately due to work, normal family things and other personal projects.  As such I've just discovered something I need to remind myself.  That is to slow the hell down so as not to come across as a bum.</p>

<p>I pride myself on understanding technical issues no matter how I learn of them.  I'll sit and think and re-read the ticket or bug.  Or I'll ask questions always building up the example in my head, going step-by-step and ensuring I am clear of the problem and my understanding of the technical system.</p>

<p>I recently have found myself jumping to conclusions and launching right into a response to people instead of careful consideration.  This is most prevalent with email, but I've done it in face-to-face conversations and even on twitter.  When I go back and read a tweet and realize all the context is actually there and my response was way off base it makes me realize some real slowing down is in order.  </p>

<p>Additionally I read a friends blog post: <a href="http://ip-sp.blogspot.com/2013/09/libtards-teabaggers-and-other-stuff.html">Libtards, Teabaggers and other stuff</a> which reminded me not to assume people I disagree with are idiots.  And for now if I have the time and come across what appears to be a vitriolic comment somewhere by someone I know I may ask questions to learn the person's position.  It has been a nice change of pace today to ask a few questions especially in light of the highly charged conversation about Government shutdown and new health care laws.  </p>

<p>Getting some reasonable answers made me feel a little less isolated  and silently annoyed.</p>
