<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Over the last few days my wife has been awesome.  She took care of a bunch of stuff, like having the heater serviced and cleaned, securing reservations for Fourth of July weekend at my Uncle's in Maryland, along with making a sandwich for my lunch almost every day.  On top of that yesterday she woke me up for work with pancakes and bacon warm and waiting.  And today she drove me into work, because my car is at Bruce's for inspection, oil change, etc.
And a bunch of other stuff she does to make my life awesome.</p>
<p>Thanks, Michelle, I love you.</p>
