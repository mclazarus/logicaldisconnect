  <p>Like Sports?  Like Fiction?  Go to my brother's new site <a title="Sport is stranger than Fiction" href="http://sportfiction.com/">Sport is stranger than Fiction</a>  and read some of the stories.  He got a bunch of his writer friends who happen to enjoy sports, probably too much.  To help contribute.  It is in the early days, but there are a few stories there.  And humor is a primary focus.
Enjoy.</p>
