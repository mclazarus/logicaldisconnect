<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I often find myself overwhelmed with paper.  I have a pretty good system to manage the stuff I know what to do with, but when I get a thing that I am not sure if I should keep, plus maybe things that have sentimental value, I feel strange tossing them, but I don't know where to put them.</p>
<p>Any of the 3 people out there that read this know of a good value scanner that works well with Linux?  I have a Visioneer 5300 USB that I have had for years.  It does not work with Linux in the least, and I think getting it to work with WinXP is a chore so I am looking to upgrade, hopefully for free or possibly cheaper.</p>
