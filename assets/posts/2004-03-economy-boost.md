  <p>And if you didn't notice in my previous post, I am doing my part to help the economy, to go along with the new desk I will need, I just got new rugs in the bedrooms.  Living room is on backorder to be installed next week.
All this goes along with Michelle's new alternator, battery and Fan belts.</p>
<p>Anyone who wants me to continue to help the economy can feel free to aid in funding this spending spree via <a href="http://www.paypal.com/">PayPal</a>.</p>
