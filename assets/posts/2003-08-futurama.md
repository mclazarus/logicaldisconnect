  <p>According to the following quote it is apparent to me that I didn't give <a href="http://www.fox.com/futurama/">Futurama</a> much of a chance back when I watched those couple of episodes, when they tried to put it on a cozy pre or post Simpson's timeslot.  Must be time to go home and set the ReplayTV.  And while I am at it might as well record <a href="http://www.fox.com/familyguy/index.html">The Family Guy</a> too.
