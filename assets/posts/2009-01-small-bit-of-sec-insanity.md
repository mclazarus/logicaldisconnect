  <p>Listening to a story about the SEC persecuting Apple because Steve Jobs is in poor health on the [WSJ](http://wsj.com/) daily read,  They compared it to a situation with HP where a director resigned.  According to the article, "Under securities laws a company needs to disclose the reasons if a director leaves over a disagreement about company policy."
Is the persecution of a company about a sick CEO or for the specific reasons behind a high level persons resignation an example of the "atmosphere of deregulation and deference to industry" I've been hearing so much about?</p>
