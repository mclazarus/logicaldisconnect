<em>John Greenleaf Whittier</em></p>
<p>The proudest now is but my peer,<br />
The highest not more high;<br />
Today, of all the weary year,<br />
A king of men am I.</p>
<p>Today, alike the great and small,<br />
The nameless and the known;<br />
My palace is the people's hall,<br />
The ballot-bow my throne!</p>
<p>Who serves today upon the list<br />
Beside the served shall stand;<br />
Alike the brown and wrinkled fist,<br />
The gloved and dainty hand!<br />
The rich is level with the poor,<br />
The weak is strong today;<br />
And sleekest broadcloth counts know more<br />
The homespun frock of gray.</p>
<p>Today let pomp and vain pretense<br />
My stubborn right abide;<br />
I set a plain man's common sense<br />
Against the pendant's pride.<br />
Today shall simple manhood try<br />
The strengthen of gold and land;<br />
The wide world has not wealth to buy<br />
The power in my right hand!</p>
<p>While there's grief to set redress,<br />
Or balance to adjust,<br />
Where weighs our living manhood less<br />
Than Mammon's vilest dust-<br />
While there's a right to need my vote,<br />
A wrong to sweep away,<br />
Up! clouted knee and ragged coat!<br />
A man's a man today!</p>
