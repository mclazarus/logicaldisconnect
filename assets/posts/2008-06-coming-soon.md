<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I am planning on resurrecting this site and posting regularly.  I have recently been made explicitly aware of the cognitive benefits of writing.  So in writing down my thoughts, especially if I intend to stand behind them and have them represent who I am, I am forced to clarify and organize the process behind my thinking.
I have decided that this practice will primarily help me to integrate new ideas.  Secondary benefits include improving my ability to communicate and will allow me to have more interesting interactions because it could be based on information I have already thought through.</p>
