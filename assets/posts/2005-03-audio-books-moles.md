<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>The ipod experiment is a success so far.  I just finished <em>The Gunslinger</em> by Stephe King.  It was pretty good, I guess this is probably the best way for me to read the dark tower series.  The only problem I have is now I have to wait until the 17th until I can get another book on my audible.com subscription.  I guess I will need to hit up the library to find some books on CD.
I also ordered some <a href="http://www.moleskine.com/eng/default.htm">Moleskine</a> pocket notebooks today.  From <a href="http://www.moleskineus.com/">Moleskineus</a>.  One I am going to use as a general purpose notebook.  The other I am going to use to start a journal to Allison, something she can read someday and see things I thought about while she was growing up.  (Thanks for <a href="http://www.ryangrier.com/archives/2005/03/30/for-the-kids/">causing me to snap into action</a> on this Ryan.)  Now I just have to make an effort to write in it.</p>
<p>I wonder if it matters what kind of pen/ink I use, I want to make sure it doesn't fade too much over the years.</p>
