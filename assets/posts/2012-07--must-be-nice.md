<p>Here is a story that illustrates exactly the type of work decisions that led to this site.  Daniel's article focuses on the lack of empathy in the person who questions his start time.  I do think her reaction was unjust and I also think the young heroic Daniel took a physical and emotional beating that is better avoided.  </p>

<p>I completely understand the <em>need</em> to continue working on an active problem—especially when all the distractions are gone.  But I suspect he probably paid for that hard work in more ways than being insulted by a co-worker.</p>
