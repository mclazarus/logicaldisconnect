<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>So I found my temporary desk replacement: the <a href="http://www.ikea-usa.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10101&amp;storeId=12&amp;productId=25905&amp;langId=-1&amp;parentCats=10121*10389">Jerker</a> from <a href="http://www.ikea.com/">IKEA</a>.  (Where the hell do the come up with these names)
I liked it because it is mostly steel, and I can easily (with an allen wrench) break it down to 5 pieces.  And be reasonably sure that I can put it back together in relatively good shape.  I used the upper shelf as a monitor stand to have the monitor raised up a little.  So it is efficient, durable and useful, and it wasn't one of those crappy all particle board ones that I saw at every other furniture place.</p>
<p>Now I have to work on designing my new corner desk.</p>
