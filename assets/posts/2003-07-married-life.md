  <p>Well its been 11 days, and so far so good.  The wedding went great, The people at <a href="http://www.cedarbrookhillcc.com/wedding.htm">Cedarbrook Hill Country Club</a> did an exemplary job.  The supporting cast was also good, particularly the videographer who got some of the best compliments from people, those being, "I don't remember the videographer at all."  So he did a great job staying out of the way.  Thanks to all my friends and family who made the day great.
Honeymoon: Disney World was awesome, the AAA Romance package is worth it, especially if you are going to eat at a fine restaraunt like "The Yachtsman Club" at the Epcot resorts, the filet mignon was tremendous, and the Oyster's Rockafeller were very good.  And Cirque du Soleil's <a href="http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/CirqueDuSoleil/en/shows/resident/lanouba">La Nouba</a> was quite an interesting and entertaining time of living it up.  I also recommend the <a href="http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/waltdisneyworld/resorts/resortindex?id=DRSWildernessLodgeRsrt&bhcp=1">Wilderness Lodge</a> as it was a great place to stay.  And I got to ride the new Epcot attraction which isn't scheduled to open until August 15, <a href="http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/waltdisneyworld/parksandmore/attractions/attractionindex?id=EPMissionSPACEAtt">Mission: SPACE</a>.  </p>
<p>All I can say is: it is one of the top 3 rides in all of Walt Disney World, it is up there with the Tower of Terror, and the Rockin Rollercoaster, although not quite as extreme as those two.  It involves clever repurposing of the old carnival concept of spinning you fast so that you stick to the wall.  But with all the requisite Disney Imagineering to make it from a simple ride into an experience.  And of course I would be remiss if I didn't mention that it starred <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Sinise,%20Gary">Lieutenant Dan</a>.</p>
<p>I have a bunch of pictures that will be added to my <a href="http://mcallister.ws/gallery">gallery</a> when I get a chance.  I had a great time, and I am sorry to have it end.  Of course if it didn't end, a couple more days of paying for food in Disney would surely have bankrupt me.</p>
