<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>this morning 227.5, woohoo!
Time to celebrate with a half-gallon of ice cream and a day off from the gym.  Alright well I won't eat the ice-cream but I have skipped the gym.  Mostly because karate ran late, then I couldn't get to sleep until around 11:45, (mainly because I was researching how to pre-compile JSP files for my work.)  And I learned in the past that going to the gym really tired too often impacts my general ability to function.  So I slept in, until 6 AM.  But the day is not a total loss, I have karate again tonight.  I just have to try really hard to get to sleep as soon as possible after class so I can make the gym tomorrow.  </p>
<p>So far so good, but I am currently pretty hungry.</p>
