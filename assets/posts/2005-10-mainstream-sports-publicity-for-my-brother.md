<p><a href="http://tom.mcallister.ws/">Tom</a> got some real mainstream sports publicity today, he was on <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/simmons/index">Bill Simmons'</a> <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=simmons/links/051017">links of the day</a>. Big sports fans need not apply, but Simmons is quite a popular online sports writer for ESPN. So maybe his adsense revenue will take a nice jump.</p>
