<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Have you forked over your <a href="http://sco.com/scosource/description.html">$699</a> in extorted protection monies yet?
Well the <a href="http://www.wordspy.com/words/Googlebombing.asp">googlebombing</a> seems to have paid off and put an actual informative page near the top of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=sco">Google's "sco" results</a> screen.  So everyone with a web page out there lets make a final push, stick this somewhere:</p>
<p>&lt;a href="http://sco.iwethey.org/"&gt;SCO&lt;/a&gt;
like this:
<a href="http://sco.iwethey.org/">SCO</a></p>
<p>It would be pretty sweet if someone at SCO managed to sneak that up on their home page in a hidden &lt;div/&gt;.  Come on, you know you want to.</p>
<p>Also you might be interested in taking a different approach suggested on the <a href="http://zgp.org/mailman/listinfo/linux-elitists">linux-elitists</a> mailing list: <a href="http://zgp.org/pipermail/linux-elitists/2003-August/006871.html">here</a>.  Basically they suggest that we may benefit from getting information directly from SCO's mouth, by calling and asking for a sales weenie to explain to us how we can become <b>legal</b> Linux users.  Or maybe request an annual report so we can consider investing in <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SCOX">SCOX</a>.  The idea being that this will cost them money to support quite a few requests by freedom lovers everywhere that are not pleased with their current noisy and irritating business practices.</p>
<p>Of course the stock price being down 10% today doesn't bode well for much except class action suits.  I guess if you already jumped on you can always file a <a href="http://www.sec.gov/complaint/cf942sec9570.htm">complaint</a> with the <acronym title="Securities and Exchange Commision">SEC</acronym>.  This tact was suggested <a href="http://zgp.org/pipermail/linux-elitists/2003-July/006776.html">here</a> and followed up <a href="http://zgp.org/pipermail/linux-elitists/2003-July/006778.html">here</a>.  Good point those sco exec's stock dumping since June have been piling up (<a href="http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1104_2-5057033.html">source</a>).</p>
<p>Also rumor has it that the IBM counterclaims were filed last night.  I would imagine you will be able to find copies shortly on both <a href="http://sco.iwethey.org/">sco.iwethey.org</a> and <a href="http://grep.law.harvard.edu/">GrepLaw</a>.</p>
<p>Update: (August 8, 2003) IBM counterclaims available <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/43592/">here</a></p>
