<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>So I finally found a fun use for my useless camera phone.  <a href="http://www.textamerica.com/">TextAmerica</a> has a neat feature where you can send the image from your phone and it will post it onto a weblog.  And they have some canned javascript so it will suck it down and stick it on some other site too.
So I have created my <a href="http://mclazarus.textamerica.com/">Moblog</a> that I will probably update a whole lot at first and then slowly neglect as I continue to be busy with work and other fun things.  Maybe I'll find some free time and make the templates between the two sites match up, and if I had even more free time, I could search for and integrate some code, so I could just do the same thing here.  But more than likely I will just use their stuff, as it is already done, and works well enough. </p>
<p>But enjoy it while it lasts.</p>
