  <p>If you are an avid reader, and want to see my book recommendations and reviews, check them out at [Library Dweller](http://mcallister.ws/librarydweller/).  Also to get an idea of my goals for that site check out the [first entry](http://mcallister.ws/librarydweller/2005/09/01/library-dweller/).  I am looking for feedback, and suggestions for *stuff* I should read also, so either comment, or send me recommendations to [mclazarus@gmail.com](mailto:mclazarus@gmail.com).</p>
