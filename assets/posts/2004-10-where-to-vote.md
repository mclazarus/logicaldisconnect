<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Find out where you are supposed to go to vote at <a href="http://www.mypollingplace.com/find.php">MyPollingPlace.com</a>.
It'd be a real shame if you went to <a href="http://vote-smart.org/">vote-smart</a> and did all of your research, and made sure you were registered, and then didn't know where to go.</p>
<p>Heck just read <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/002054.php">this</a> whole thing.  It tells you what to do if you know you are in the right place and you aren't being permitted to vote for some reason.  Basically you can still cast a provisional ballot.</p>
