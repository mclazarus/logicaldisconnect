<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I won the Spam lottery!  Some jerk on an Israeli ISP decided to use my email address as the sender on a bunch of junk he sent out last night.</p>
<p>So today I got to learn all about how well the Barracuda SPAM firewall works, how many bad addresses this dude had on his list, and finally how many people are on vacation, or neglected to turn off their on vacation auto-reply.</p>
<p>
I think the solution to this is to train the Bayesian filter that is built into spam assassin a couple extra times today.  Of course the only downside to that is I may never see a legitimately bounced email again.</p>
