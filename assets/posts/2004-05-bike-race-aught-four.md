<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>The Manayunk Drinking competition is coming up fast.  June 6th is the <a href="http://www.procyclingtour.com/race_overview.cfm/race_id/6">Wachovia USPRO Championship</a>.  And since it is likely that this year may be the last where my brother has a house along the route he has stepped up admirably.  To go along with the standard fare of 2 kegs of beer, and various dead animals, there is the centerpiece dead animal, a 40 lb. roast pig.  They will be getting this from <a href=""http://www.cannulismeats.com/">Cannuli's Meats</a> in South Philly that specializes in the preparation of these delicacies for similair unholy celebrations.  The drinking starts at 6:30 AM, and the definition of "Bike Race Drunk" becomes evident by about noon.  There are also rumors that some kind of athletic competition will be ongoing, but I am skeptical.
You can read my review of <a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/500c727de4b0d820d6a42ad8/515f5893e4b0f7bed43ad1d5/515f59bce4b0f7bed43ae759/1365203388917/000055.html?format=original">the debauchery from 2003</a>.  There are also some <a href="http://mcallister.ws/gallery/bikerace03">crappy pictures</a>.  I am hoping to repair my Aiptek pen cam in time to get some better pictures this year.  And I am also hoping to hang in without getting totally wrecked, but only time will tell.</p>
