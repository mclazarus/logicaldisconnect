<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>We have one of those <a href="http://www.keurig.com/">Keurig</a> coffee makers at work, and while I despise coffee I love Tea, especially Earl Grey and Green Tea.  I have managed to keep that stocked here pretty well through various cajoling and convincing one other co-worker to imbibe the Earl Grey.  </p>
<p>With our latest order we just got a sample pack of Gloria Jean's Chai, and it may turn into my new mini-obsession, has a nice Cinnamon taste, and was very refreshing.  Actually when I first started drinking I was disappointed it smelled very much like Cinnamon, which is clearly the most superior of all spices, but the taste was pretty weak.  I did a quick search and found <a href="http://www.odie.org/chai/whatisit.html">here</a> that "chai must have sweetness or the spices seem to lose their full robustness."  I added one packet of Splenda and found the spice emboldened and embiggened, much to my enjoyment.</p>
<p>
I now have to hide the remaining 4 packs from the sample and then somehow get more in here.</p>
