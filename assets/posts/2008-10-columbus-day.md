  <p>A day late, but here is my thought on yesterday's holiday.
Ninety men in three small ships sailed west from Europe for over a month, when dawn came on October 12, 1492, the sun rose on a new world.  Columbus, the motive power behind this expedition, was a man of independent mind that challenged the authority of the "experts" and of the whole world. He discovered America, bringing European civilization to our shores.  A critical and historic event that sowed the seeds of what was to become the freest and most prosperous country ever, the United States of America.</p>
<p>When thinking of yesterday, I remember the greatness, the courage, the independent judgment of a man.</p>
