  <p>Ryan [asked](http://logicaldisconnect.org/archives/2005/09/09/the-final-hour/#comment-1235) "was it worth the trip?"Oh yes.  At least for me it was.</p>
<p>It was a great epic tale, with a great ending.  And I am talking about the real ending after King suggested you stop reading.  I would have been disappointed if I had skipped that last part.</p>
<p>Actually there was one thing that did disappoint me, the author's note was not included in the audio recording.  I had noticed that there was one in the hardback version, which I picked up at B&N to look at the drawings yesterday.  Now I have to read that note next time I am in a book store.  </p>
<p>I enjoyed the story so much I almost bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=logicaldiscon-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0451213041%2526tag=logicaldiscon-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0451213041%25253FSubscriptionId=048656PF073H3HPEQ4G2" title="View product details at Amazon">The Road to the Dark Tower : Exploring Stephen King's Magnum Opus</a> while I was out yesterday, with my coupons and gift cards.  I figured I could use a break from the tower for a while.</p>
