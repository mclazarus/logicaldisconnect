  <p><a href="http://www.simplyaudiobooks.com/">Simply Audiobooks</a> looks interesting.  They are applying the same model to books on CD that netflix applied to DVDs.
Once my audible.com subscription is up I may have to try this, if I am not sick of listening to books by then, Even if I only need to have the books in my hands long enough to transfer them to my ipod.  It's too bad that piracy fears will never have a company that will do this unlimited type of service with electronic delivery.</p>
