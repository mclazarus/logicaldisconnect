<p>I ordered the EASY SET UP for $160. for my new Dell computer and when the local tech. from Bank Tech. Serv. couldn't migrate the data and get the computer going and finish the installation, he called Dell & they told him to disconnect the computer and leave. From 1:00 - 5:15 I've been talking with Cust. Serv. and Tech. Serv. and both tell me to call the other. You wait, you get disconnected, or they tell you to call someone else.  I asked them to send the Dell tech. back and they said they only send them once, that's all I paid for, and there are no second visits or refunds on that. We need to do everything to stop this.  I will get my money back through persistence or an atty. but what about the millions who are not able to do that?</p>
