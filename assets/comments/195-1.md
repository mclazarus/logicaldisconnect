<p>So you got me thinking, how would a swiss army knife look under x-ray...would is simply look like regangular piece of metal or would the machine be able to sharply display the knife piece and have it look distinct against the flat-head screw driver and can opener?
Clearly, nail clippers always look like nail clippers, but if you have 50 nail clippers in a bag, would you still be able to tell they are nail clippers under x-ray?</p>
<p>Point being, perhaps the x-ray screeners are not that well trained that they can actually spot the curves of the knife blade against the densly packed swiss amry knife...maybe the intel community should track purchases of the really big swiss army knives.</p>
<p>I'm going to hi-jack you with this...oh wait, that's a tooth pick.</p>
