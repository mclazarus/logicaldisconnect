<p>Kevin, I'm sorry that I missed reading this yesterday.  I love you so much & I am so incredibly lucky to have you & Allison in my life.  Thank you for making me the happiest person ever!!!  I love YOU!!!!
Allison's asleep but I will read it to her when she wakes up.  She may not understand the words but you can see it in her eyes that she understands how great you are & how much you love her.  The smile that she gives at just the sound of your voice tells me that she loves you, too.</p>
