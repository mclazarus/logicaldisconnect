<p>I have not verified that this works, but I suggest that you clearly, visibly separate the items like so:
1. Did you get the memo about the TPS report cover sheet?</p>
<p>2. The printer is showing the error "PC Load Letter". What does this mean?</p>
<p>3. Can you fix #2?</p>
<p>4. Can I have a raise?</p>
<p>This separates the items visually, and leaves space for the reader/respondant to answer each question individually.</p>
