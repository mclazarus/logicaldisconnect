<p>I loved the Dark Tower series.  I think Frank Muller originally read The Gunslinger, but Stephen King released an revised version of it a few years ago and that's when George Guidall read it.
I loved the very end of the last book (the ending).  There is a point in the book where you are suggested to stop reading so the ending can be what you've always imagined it.  But, I think the real ending is just such a fitting ending.  </p>
<p>If you look at Stephen King's website (or even here: http://www.thedarktower.net/connections/), you'll see that SO many other books by Stephen King actually tie into The Dark Tower series.  One of my favorites is Hearts In Atlantis.  But, I am STILL reading through books that make a connection to The Dark Tower.  There are just so many of them. </p>
<p>I'm glad that you like The Dark Tower series.  I liked it ever since I first picked it up in Junior High School.  And it's been around even longer than that (since the 70's).  I'm glad that both he and I lived long enough to finish the entire series.</p>
