<p>Monkeys can actually do things, my experience with Cavtel's customer service and repair people shows them to be more like monkey excrement.It just lays there and stinks.
I tried having DSL added to my phone line. After 3 weeks of waiting since placing my order, they finally shipped the modem and installation wasn't bad.
They didn't tell me I would be without dial tone for a whole day while they switched the line to digital. Then upon testing the DSL speed, I get less than 300K !.  I had ~1.4M with Verizon, and ~3M with Comcast cable. This really blows!  So, I called Cavtel to complain, they tell me that there is nothing that they can do to speed up the DSL, so I cancel the stinky service. They not only took away the DSL, but again the dial tone is gone (now for 3 days-and nobody there knows why?).
I have been on hold with different departments for a grand total of about 6 hours to date. Their customer service people must be trained to just lie, or transfer you to another department when they don't know the answer. I have been promised solutions, told that my account was cancelled, told that it must be wiring problems in my house, and just hung up on without warning.
You are really taking a risk dealing with this company.</p>
