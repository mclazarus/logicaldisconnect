<p>Yo...I have 2 things to say.
First...Michelle, my dear, the happiest day/luckiest day of your life should be Feb 4th 1976 because that is my b-day. Had I not been born, the chances of you meeting Kevin are slim to none.</p>
<p>Second...Kevin, my Gally, there should be a special section of your flockin website to honor my hockey skills through the years. Remember, had I not graced my presence as an SJU IceHawk, the chances of you meeting Michelle and having Allison woul be even slimmer to none.</p>
<p>I am a daisy and I will!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
