<p>Generally speaking, I run into this when I have reached a point in problem solving where I am no longer looking for an answer but am stuck in re-stating the problem.  I am usually going in circles, and subconciously realize that I have to move away from the problem.Or I have to re-focus, instead of fixing the problem, I have to work backwards from what the results should be.
I usually break away and let my subconcious mind work on the real problem, while I tidy up an easier problem.</p>
