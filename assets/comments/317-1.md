<p>Good luck Kevin,I did that too about a year ago.  I ended up going from about 215 to 165.  The trip there sucks a little, but it's well worth it.  I'm sure you probably read a bit on my experience here (http://www.ryangrier.com/archives/2005/04/13/on-diet/), but it is well worth it.</p>
<p>I have also set other goals.  Like, I plan on running in the Philadelphia 8k (http://www.philadelphiamarathon.com/).  I find goals like that have also helped me get on the ball with running and lifting. </p>
<p>Good luck.</p>
