<p>BTW, The entire embedded and consumer electronic digital cable regulation movement bagan back before 2000 when Circuit City started lobbying Congress and the FCC to mandate 'removal security' mechanisms for digital cable.
Reasoning: Circuit City could get part of the profit of selling digital cable ready TVs and set-tops.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the top twp digital cable equipment companies have spent the past 10 years making their technology work... Consumer Electronic companies have a lot of catching up to do...will the consumer benefit from more product choices...maybe, but they'll have to shell out $200-900 for set-tops and additional costs rather than rent a set-top for $8/month.</p>
<p>I could go on and on...but I'd have to have you sign an NDA. </p>
