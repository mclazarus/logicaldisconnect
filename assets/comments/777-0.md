<p>She looks so much bigger on the computer than on my phone.  I'm glad that picture came out so well!  I'm still upset that she had no problem leaving me.  A very small part of me hopes that when I go to pick her up she's huddled in the corner crying her eyes out for her Mommy! and that's how she spent all morning; that is how I wanted to spend all morning, crying for Alli!  The entire rest of me wants her to be running around doing all the activities with all the other kids &amp; being very reluctant to leave.  I'm sure she's doing fine today, as she will everyday...hopefully by November I'll be doing okay too!</p>
