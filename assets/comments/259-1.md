<p><a href="http://www.cafepress.com/" rel="nofollow">CafePress</a> just needs to add them, so I can login create an account pick what the heck I want on there.  And then put a fancy link on my website here so people can support the McAllister Nation.
Of course my google adwords are all about them now.  So I guess I can just click on those.</p>
