<p>yeah, hard work sucks sometimes.  Especially when it is hard because it is tedius or boring and not because it is actually challenging in a stimulating kind of way.
Yeah, I have been paying the idiot tax for a couple weeks now.  Because one day on a whim I bought a ticket and won $4.  So I figured I would buy 4 more, (I only buy one for each drawing), then on my last one there I won $7.  So I have $5 left or when this currently insanely huge jackpot goes way, I'll stop.</p>
