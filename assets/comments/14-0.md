<p>10/11/03 DEll does not offer any satisfactory product support. they lie to you, dis-connect your phone connection, don't call you back and that's on a brand new system sold to a small biz. 1st day the problems began and 7 days and many frustrating hours later I still can't use my new DELL. And no calls back to even imitate concern or support. 
How can they get away with it? Come Monday if they haven't taken care of me, I will be contacting my attourney general.</p>
