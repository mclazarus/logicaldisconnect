<p>What about small colorless ballon-like spots, about the size and appearance of a bubble in a glass of ginger ale, that appear suddenly, move down and to periphery, but disappear if I try to look directly at them? They're a short-term thing, disappearing in about 10 seconds, max. I've seen these maybe 3 or 4 times in my life and it just happened again. They're very distinct, like a swarm of tiny gnats, and somewhat disturbing.
Thanks,</p>
