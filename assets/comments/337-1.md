<p>Thanks.  Its a [Samsung A900](http://www.engadget.com/2005/11/11/the-samsung-mm-a900-aka-blade/) on Sprint.  It was an unexpectedly early Christmas present from Allison to both of us ;)  Turns out to get the deal she wanted she had to activate it immediately, instead of waiting until Sunday.
It's got that fancy new EVDO network, so the network stuff is fast.</p>
