<p>The Padres have home games against the Cubs on Thursday and Friday at 10:05 EST.  Mildly interesting, I guess, although I hear that Tony Gwynn fella has retired.
Or, you could check roadsideamerica.com for wacky attractions in your area. I don't know what areas are near San Diego, so I am of little help.  </p>
<p>Or you could do like I did while stranded in Atlanta when i was 12 and not invited to a wedding mom and dad went to: order a pay-per-view movie, eat a medium domino's pizza, and drink a 4-pack of yoo-hoo.  Diets don't count if you're not in the time zone in which you started them. </p>
