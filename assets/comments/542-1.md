<p>Ive long maintained that the difference between honors students and regular students is not so much rooted in some intelligence gap, but the fact that they actually pay attention, listen, and do what they are supposed to do.  As a teacher, I can assure you that just about nothing is more frustrating than having to repeat every god damn thing at least twice, and then still having a couple students who cant remember it.</p>
