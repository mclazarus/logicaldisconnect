<p>You miss the point of telephone number portability...yes, your cell phone remembers everyone elses number...so what happens if I move or change providers (land line or cellular) and portability did not exist...you'd be calling my old number...once more, you wouldn't even know it's my old number since you never actually dial it.
Telephone number portability good, IPv4 portability bad...of course, if the ARIN policy is proven illegal somehow, I still have some Verio address space registered to me that I would be able to take use of. :)</p>
