<p>I have had CavTel since 2002 and everything was fine you used to be able to call the tech department and get something fixed or added in a few moments. Well, I lost phone service and DSL on Wednesday, when I got home and called I was put on hold for 43 minutes, then when I finally got someone they had no idea as to what was wrong. Now I have had Phonom serive for 4 yrs and only had one failure and it was corrected quickly. Now after many calls waits I find that they no longer support the service. two days had gone byand now I find that I can switch to their C2 service or just a standard line. Well about 2 months ago FIOS was installed in my area so I have switched back to Verizon for 69.95/month and it will be installed in by Wednesday which is when I could have returned to standard copper service for 66/month Oh and by the way Google mail Sucks!</p>
