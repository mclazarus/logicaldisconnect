<p>RE: Dropbox alternative</p>
<p>If you've got large amounts of data to sync, you may want to consider taking a look at iCloud (http://www.icloud.com).  I find it is often dismissed because it's primarily marketed as a cloud OS, but in truth, I have yet to find any other cloud storage provider that comes close in value (25GB for just over $4/mo; a little over $8/mo for 100GB!).</p>
<p>I'm not a mac user, but I've been using iCloud to sync between Ubuntu Mav and several Windows variants.  I've never had any access issues or downtime, and plan to renew soon for a third year.  After some extensive trial-and-error, I even managed to mount the webDAV share directly to my Linux boxes.  I've never even bothered with the cloud-based OS features.</p>
<p>One glaring omission that keeps it from being the end-all solution (IMO) is lack of ftp access, but their forums seem to indicate that the idea is not abandoned.</p>
<p>My $.02 - Hope it helps.</p>
