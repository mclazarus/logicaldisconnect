<p>Thanks, Ryan.
Yeah going from 298 - 218 was no picnic, but it is really cool when you realize your clothes are too big.  And when you do something physical and realize what a difference it made.  </p>
<p>I think I first realized, one day when I played basketball, when I had first reached 225 on the way down.  And I ran 5 straight full court games (about 90 minutes to 2 hours of playing) with no problem, beating young boys up and down the court and never being out of breath.  </p>
<p>I can still run pretty well, but this time I want to try and acquire some quickness too, I think if I get quicker it will help me a lot in my martial arts studies.  Also I want my endurance to go over the top this time.  I want to be the guy who never gets winded.</p>
