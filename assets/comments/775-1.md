<p>Yeah, it actually hasn't been too terrible.  It seems the stuff I am commenting on isn't sports related so there are typically only a handful of people commenting.  A good example is here:http://www.philly.com/inquirer/opinion/26945254.html</p>
<p>Where there is a debate about public housing.</p>
<p>However, I have seen the nonsense of which you speak and if there are already too many comments, or too many dumb comments, I won't bother.</p>
