<p>Kevin,</p>
<p>No reason to question her dedication. I guess its always possible for someone to get tired of their career or decide something else is more intersting. However, if people are treating you poorly it sounds it's probably, at minimum a contributing factor.</p>
<p>So based on your supposition, you expect to see a general movement of people away from occupations with the most regulations toward those with less regulations? That's reasonable and it seems like a testible hypothesis to me; I wonder if there is any data to support it?</p>
