<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>With a renewed interest in blogging, I decided to try out <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a> and came across some Drafts I'd partially written but never published.  So I've reformatted this one a bit and you get it now.  This was originally started on July 1, 2010.
Over the summer I happened upon a small pool of water around my Air conditioner in the basement which immediately began an hours long investigation and repair and left me feeling a bit glad but annoyed.  </p>
<p>I was glad that I was able to identify the cause of the problem and repair it, in only a few hours.  But I was annoyed that my plans for the evening were shot, and I had an ugly and distorted sense that I'm never able to do the things I really want to do, but must always spend my time responding to emergencies that are my duty.  </p>
<p>I know this view is wrong, but over the prior 9 months or so I'd taken on so much more stuff than I ever had before that I had been wavering between resentment against the world at large and anxiety about not being able to achieve my goals.</p>
<p>I think this experience and my response was a big step on my recovery from <a href="/logical-disconnect-1/archives/2010/10/15/resolve">going crazy</a>.  I reminded myself that to accept those thoughts, about never achieving my goals, would bring about a self-fulfilling prophecy.  And I reminded myself to see how the choices I make even in response to the unexpected emergencies are serving the values I want to achieve and keep. </p>
<p>It was at this time that I also realized I'd gotten impatient.  And couldn't remember having that problem since I was a wee tyke when I'd get pissed struggling to untie my shoes.</p>
<p>I think by repeatedly reinforcing a view that I should be getting more done than I was, and actually more than was possible was causing me to have an always present sense of impatience and frustration with myself and others.</p>
<p>I had decided that fulfilling my ambitions should be easy and when I couldn't do it I'd damn the universe for being impossible and myself for not succeeding anyway.</p>
<p>In the end I had to challenge the bad premises by comparing them with reality, and clear out those thoughts that had been gumming up my life.</p>
<p>Oh and if your interested about the AC.  I took it apart cleaned a bunch of nasty sludge that had accumulated in the drip pan under the coil.  And then using an old wire as a snake, dislodged sludge from the upper part of the pipe.  Finally hooking up a shop vac to the end of the condensate line and sucked out anything that would come.  It worked fine the rest of the summer.  And if there is a next time.  First thing I'll do is hook up the shop vac.</p>
<p>So, Anyone have recommendations for companies to clean and service HVAC units annually?</p>
