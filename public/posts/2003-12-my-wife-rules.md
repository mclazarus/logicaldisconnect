<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>She stole my car!
Ordinarily that wouldn't make much sense, but in this case it was the exact right thing to do.  I asked her to find me somewhere to get my oil changed and my windsheild fixed or replaced.  So she did, she tried to get a hold of me but I was busy in meetings this morning, and left my cell phone in my jacket.  So she came and stole my car to get the oil changed and get the windshield inspected.  </p>
<p>Luckily she thought to leave me the keys to her car so I can get home.  Anyway, Michelle is the best!</p>
