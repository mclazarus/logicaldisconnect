<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>In the past week more than six times as many messages were delivered to my spam folder by spamassassin than my inbox.  (not counting mailing list traffic).  I also probably had about 10 - 15 spammy messages sneak through to my inbox.  So thats:
<ul>
<li>59 to INBOX</li>
<li>373 to the caughtspam folder</li>
<li>10 misses</li>
<li>0 false alarms</li>
</ul>
<p>That means I got 7.8 times as much spam as I got messages in my inbox.  I am sure there are much greater horror stories out there, but damn, I really am not going to buy a rolex or prescription drugs based on an email that looks like a ransom note, because of all the interspersed mispellings and numbers to try and make it through my filters.</p>
