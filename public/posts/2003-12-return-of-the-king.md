  <blockquote><p>One of the cardinal rules of filmmaking:
<p><b>Any movie where one large group of people with swords runs at an opposing group of people with swords is awesome.</b></p>
<p>Lord of the Rings: Return of the King employs this trick about 172 times, therefore making it whatever awesome times 172 is.</p>
