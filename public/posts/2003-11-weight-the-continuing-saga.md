<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>227.0 lbs.  Hit the gym again, just ran again was running late.  20+5 minutes 2.65 mi.
somehow I injured my right rib in the past 3 days.  I don't remember getting hit at all at karate, maybe I strained a muscle somehow?  But it is quite sensitive to touch.</p>
<p>... back to work.</p>
