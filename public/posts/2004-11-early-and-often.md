<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I was finalizing some research for my vote tomorrow morning, and I noticed that the <a href="http://vote-smart.org/">vote-smart</a> site didn't seem to have all the Pennsylvania races that are of interest to me.  So I found that <a href="http://congress.org/">congress.org</a> seems to have some more complete listings.  So I am looking at PA attorney general, auditor general and state treasurer tonight.
I also found that the <a href="http://www.pa.lwv.org/">League of Women Voters</a> has a nice 2 page <a href="http://www.pa.lwv.org/voting/vg2004.pdf">PA statewide voters guide</a> that gives a good summary of all the major races.</p>
