<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>My brother and his friends grew up in a time when instant messaging was king.  They all would come home and IM each other until really late.  And in college it was a way to keep tabs on friends, because you could fill your profile and away message with witty, sarcastic, stupid or good information.  I have seen party invitations made exclusively via away message.  Some people take great pride in their ability to have funny away messages, and have grown a great readership of their away messages, or away message stalkers as I have heard them called.
I have been away message stalking my brother for a while, occassionally I miss some of his good ones, but often I find myself reading his messages aloud to my co-workers.  So in an attempt to make sure I don't miss even a single message I thought it would be a good idea to write some kind of software that would grab his messages and syndicate them into an RSS feed or a weblog or something.  So I did.  With the help of <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a>, <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/">Twisted</a> and <a href="http://pyblogger.sf.net/">pyBlogger</a> I have thrown together a quick Python program that logs into the AOL IM network using the OSCAR protocol (I would have used the public TOC protocol but AOL has crippled it, and I think sometimes has TOC outages) and monitors Tom's status and blogs his away messages seconds after he makes them.  You can check out the archive at <a href="http://tom.mcallister.ws/away/">Tom is Away</a>.  </p>
<p>I imagine there will be some problems with it as I just threw it together, but I plan on publishing the code once I clean it up a little more, so others can set up away message stalking sites.  Anyway enjoy the hilarity of Tom's syndicated Away messages.</p>
