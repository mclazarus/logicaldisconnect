  <p>Warning this is just a rant, but it does contain a useful piece of advice.&nbsp; If you are looking for a Job, especially if you have absolutely no experience.&nbsp; Don't just spam your résumé at companies.&nbsp; Try writing a cover letter for the job, and even tailor your résumé appropriately.&nbsp; Is this&nbsp;extra work?&nbsp; Yes, of course it is.&nbsp; But I have a question for you, do you want the job?</p>
<p>I knew this sounded familiar, apparently, <a href="/logical-disconnect-1/archives/2005/02/04/resume-mountain-reduction">I wrote about it before</a>.&nbsp; Last time I was trying to hire someone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So even though I stole my own thunder, here is the bottom line.&nbsp; If you are going to get a job, a human is going to read your application.&nbsp;&nbsp;Treat the hiring person as a human.&nbsp;&nbsp;Reach out to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ask them a question.&nbsp; Sure, you need a résumé that meets all the keyword search tests, or whatever way some numb nuts HR person is going to use to sort through them all, but, read the job description.&nbsp; Think about the job.&nbsp; Think about the person who is going to make
the decision.&nbsp; Write that person a letter explaining what you find interesting about the job posting.&nbsp; Be honest.</p>
<p>I would be more likely to&nbsp;look twice at&nbsp;a&nbsp;candidates application if they had a letter that was written with me as the audience.&nbsp; And remember the letter is not a class assignment.&nbsp; Write it like you are writing to a human being.</p>
<p>Anyway deleting monster.com emails always frustrates me.</p>
