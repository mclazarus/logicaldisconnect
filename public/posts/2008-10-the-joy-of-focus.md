<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Today I forgot to eat breakfast and got moving very late because I was immersed in what I was doing.  Spending so much time being interrupted and allowing myself to be interrupted I had started to forget the pure and simple joy of focused, productive work.  I intended to try and achieve that state as often as possible.  I need to blow off a few meeting reminders, phone calls and the like.  It's good for the soul.</p>
