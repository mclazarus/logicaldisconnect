<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>If only it were possible to somehow force yourself to do the exact opposite thing you are about to do, because you know full well the next thing you do will be absolutely wrong.
This is how I feel right now because I am totally wiped out, and I have reached the point where I know I will make 3 mistakes for every one thing I do right.  But because I am at that point there is no way for me to conciously avoid the mistake.  I guess the only smart thing to do is go to just stop and go to sleep.  But...I press on.</p>
