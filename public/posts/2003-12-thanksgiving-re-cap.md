  <p>Thanksgiving with Mom, Tom and my wife was great, I missed having my dad there, but I love spending time with my Mom.  Breakfast with the in-law's for three straight days was good, it made sure that I got my fill of eggs and bacon those days.  And Michelle and her Mom spent Friday and Saturday baking about a million Christmas cookies at my house.
It gave me time to run the new phone lines to my office, and to get quite a bit of Madden franchise time in.  I won the superbowl and then started trading all my old players for draft picks and young players.  (Note: always keep the signing bonus money as low as possible, unless you are sure you will keep the player through the end of the contract, even if it means a higher overall salary)</p>
<p>Then the Eagles continued to be awesome with their 7th straight victory.  Thank goodness that Fox forgot how to use timeouts and Kasay forgot how to kick field goals.  </p>
<p>Then I helped Frank move some of his new (used) furniture from his cousin's condo into his new condo.  All in all a busy, yet oftentimes restful long weekend.</p>
