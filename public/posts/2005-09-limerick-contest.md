<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Like **sports** and **rhyming**?
Then write a limerick for [my brother's contest](http://tom.mcallister.ws/2005/09/16/contest-announcement/).  I have yet to grace the pages with my entries, but I do plan to enter the contest.  And if you don't want to enter you can at least see the entries so far.</p>
