<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I am catching up reading my [Asimov's](http://www.asimovs.com/) subscription and just finished up August.  I enjoyed the story telling in [Paul Melko's](http://www.sff.net/people/melko/) [The Summer of the Seven](http://www.sff.net/people/melko/biblio.htp#sots).  Thinking back there were no particularly amazing storylines or anything, it was just a well written story that kept me hooked.  I did enjoy the world he set up there, and wouldn't mind reading some more about it.  It seems to be either part of a bigger work or just additional exploration of his current novel in progress, so I'll be sure to check out *Singularity's Ring* when I can get my hands on it.</p>
