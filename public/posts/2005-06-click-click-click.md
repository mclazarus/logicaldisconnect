  <p>Well it sounds like my ReplayTV has abrubtly died :-(
There was a short period where it was acting <em>strange</em>, but that was only for a few days, I came home and found it rebooting and never quite finishing, a hard reboot fixed that.  </p>
<p>But this morning it wouldn't come on when I hit the power button.  Undaunted I did another hard reboot.  This time I was pierced to the bone with a rapid clicking sound from hell, I could feel it vibrate in the hollow of my temples and hammer against my soul.</p>
<p>Looks like Mikeyboy of <a href="http://www.replaytvparts.com/">replaytvparts</a> is going to get a few of my bucks, unless there is somewhere out there I can get the ReplayTV software image to push onto a new disk that I buy, which I would do just to save some money.  First thing to do when I get the replacement drive is to pull the OS image off of it in case a similar need arises in the future.</p>
