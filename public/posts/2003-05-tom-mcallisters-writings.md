  <p>I have been granted permission by my brother to publish some of his work on my site.  It will remain his Copyright and he retains the rights to his work.  But he is making his opinion available, and the first published work there is <a href="http://mcallister.ws/tom/bush-hitler.html" title="History Repeated">History Repeated</a>: A research paper comparing the rise in power of George W. Bush to that of Adolph Hitler.</p>
<p>I have always been impressed with my brother's ability to express himself in writing, and have always enjoyed reading his work.  In my opinion it is usually quite excellent, and his short stories are nothing short of phenomenal, particularly when it comes to character development.  So I have at long last created a repository to share his work with the world.</p>
<p>Currently that is the only work available there, however I plan to get more stuff up there shortly.  So feel free to check out <a href="http://mcallister.ws/tom/" title="Scrawlings of Tom McAllister">Scrawlings of Tom McAllister</a>.</p>
