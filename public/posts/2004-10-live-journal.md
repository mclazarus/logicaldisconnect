<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I am trying out the <a href="http://jason.goldsmith.us/dev/projects/wordpress-plugins/live-press/">LivePress plugin</a> to keep <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/mclazarus/">my live journal</a> account synced up with this one.  Just because I know a few people that are all into live journal, and why not have a mirror of my site.
So this should be the first entry on my live journal site.</p>
