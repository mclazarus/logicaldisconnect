<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>For those that don't know, I am a yellow belt in Karate, and currently working to learn more, usually 3 days a week.  I study at a <a href="http://www.villari.net/index.htm">Fred Villari's</a> studio in Trevose.  The chief instructor is Jim Wing, there he teaches me <a href="http://www.kickboxingcentral.com/">Shaolin Kempo Karate</a>.</p>
<p>I am in an advanced training class where I get to go to as many group classes as I can get to, and I get one semi-private lesson a week.  Last night, I suffered some bruised ribs as Jim explained the finer points of showing no mercy to someone who attempted to stab you.  In this case I was the simulated stabber... <i>Ouch</i><br />
However, there appears to be no permanent damage, and I derived considerable utility learning more about the nuances of footwork and lines of sight.</p>
<p>Additionally I now know for sure if someone tries to stab me and I get him on the ground and stomp on his ribs, he will be displeased</p>
