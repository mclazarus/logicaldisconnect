<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Got in to work around 6, haven't eaten lunch.  That means it's been 9 straight hours of work, and it's nice out.  That also means it's time for a break and to collect on that 800 - 1000 calories I am owed today[*](#fn1).  So I am [walking](http://tinyurl.com/8htam) to get a [sandwich](http://primohoagies.com/).  I'll also probably pay the [idiot tax](http://powerball.com/) while I'm out.
<a name="fn1">*</a>: I had a small banana and 6 bread & butter pickle chips.  I estimate that to be around 100 calories.</p>
