<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Just wanted to get more noise out there that the new E521 distributed by Dell isn't working right under Linux.  Specifically I have tried Ubuntu 6.06 But there are others reporting problems with other distros and lots of different people trying different kernels.</p>
<p>Anyway, I have started a thread on the <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=279626">ubuntuforms</a> and one on <a href="http://forums.us.dell.com/supportforums/board/message?board.id=sw_other&message.id=54328&view=by_date_ascending&page=1">Dell's forums</a> that are getting a fair amount of traffic.  I have also contacted Dell support with no luck, but I suggest everyone who bought this system with the intent to run Linux contact support too, making noise that they can see may help push some results.  I also put a feeler out to <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/support/paid">Canonical</a> about maybe purchasing support to address this issue.</p>
<p>
I am holding off submitting a bug to the Ubuntu guys because they have their hands full with tomorrows release, plus I want to try out Edgy and see how it runs.  If I can reproduce the problem there I will submit the bug and renew some detailed troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
But if you are looking for a new machine and you want to run linux on it and don't want any problems, forget Dell and go for <a href="http://system76.com/index.php">system76</a>.  I can't speak for their quality or support because I haven't tried it, but I can say if I had this to do over I would have just ordered a similar machine for slightly higher cost from them.</p>
