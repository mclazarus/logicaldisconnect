<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>As in, a few hours I will be plastered.  It's been some time, but Since [Mike](http://webcodefocus.com/) is getting married and it is his batchelor party, I guess now is as good a time as any.  And if I am plastered in a few, I think there is probably a more profound state of drunkeness that he will reach.  I think just short of comatose is my goal.
CAR BOMBS AWAY!</p>
