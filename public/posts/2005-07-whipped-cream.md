<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>working from home is really blowing up my whip cream budget.  Every day I eat a jello pudding cup for lunch either fat free or sugar free.  The tastes are good and they are 100 or 60 calories respectively.  A while back I discoverd they are great with just a little bit of whipped cream on top.  Now that I am home I can always have this little treat!  The real point is I am less tempted to run out to fast food joint at home.  So lunch can remain relatively inexpensive and healthy.</p>
