<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>If you are interested in Linux and the status of the SCO vs. IBM debacle that is going on, probably the best place to follow it is on, <a href="http://kmself.home.netcom.com/index.html" title="Karsten M. Self's Home Page">Karsten Self's</a> wiki <a href="http://twiki.iwethey.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/SCOvsIBM">here</a>.  You can also follow along on the <a href="http://zgp.org/mailman/listinfo/linux-elitists">linux-elitists</a> mailing list or associated archives.</p>
<p>Lots of good information, and a high signal to noise on the linux-elitists list.  If you are interested in <q>Hard free software questions and clever answers.</q></p>
<p>Let me close this entry with a quote from Darl McBride the SCO Group CEO in August 2002 (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=6293">reference</a>).</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=6293">
<p>Obviously Linux owes its heritage to UNIX, but not its code.
We would not, nor will not, make such a claim.</p>
