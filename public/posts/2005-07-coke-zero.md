<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>A little while back I wrote about <a href="/logical-disconnect-1/archives/2005/05/11/diet-coke-with-splenda">coke with splenda</a> in summary I said it doesn't suck.  Well coke zero doesn't suck even more.  It goes a step further than splenda coke did in removing the bad aftertaste of diet coke, it actually has a good taste.  It isn't exactly the great sweet coke taste that helped me reach 300 lbs back in college, but it is good taste.
Anyway I hope it doesn't cause cancer or superflu or anything like that because I drink like 3 of them a day now, to keep my caffeine addiction honed to a fine edge.</p>
