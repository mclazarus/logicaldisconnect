<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I just finished updating my brother's writing repository.  There are now two distinct sections, one is creative work, the other is Academic or Research type writing.  Now you have your readings of: "Lamenting Murph," "Seeing Uncle Mike," "Hunger Pains," "Cooking the Sacred Cow," "Hidden Tears," and two essays written as part of an application for a scholarship.  Of course "History Repeated" is still available there as well.  I threw a very short description of the story there if I had read it.  Enjoy.  And if you are in a position to give my brother a job writing, then do it.  So head over to <a href="http://mcallister.ws/tom/" title="Scrawlings of Tom McAllister">Scrawlings of Tom McAllister</a> and get reading.</p>
