<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I switched all my feeds over to [feedburner](http://feedburner.com/).  Two reasons, first it's the best, easiset, way I know of to track readership of my feeds.  Second maybe someday I can liter my feed with ads too ;-).
But it is a little interesting to see statistics.  And to realize no one is reading my [Library Dweller](http://mcallister.ws/librarydweller/) blog.  Okay it just started, but I think I know people who read.  I also know people who buy crap at amazon, and for some reason aren't using [my referal links](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=logicaldiscon-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=http://www.amazon.com/), shame on you!</p>
<p>**Update** oh and if you are already reading my site via a feed, then you don't need to do anything.  The magic of apache rewrite is taking care of it for you... well I guess for me, since you never asked for this.  Just make me some free money dammit!</p>
