  <p>This movie was great.  I caught it at 7PM last night, and all I can say is wow.  There was a great story, I really liked the production effort put into trying to make it more like a comic book, with the split views and vibrant colors.
And everyone who thought the CG hulk was going to be too cartoonish, no way.  I mean come on, do you want Lou Ferrigno to play him some more?  He is more cut out for security guard work than anything else.  But seriously it was quite easy to suspend disbelief for that big monster.  And guess what, they had a pretty good story going on too.  So enjoy.</p>
