<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>So far I have been generally pleased with <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/" title="MovableType">MT</a>.  It makes it rather easy to add content, I have been able to simply and effectively change the layout.  (Well it is currently one of the example layouts, but I get the idea)  It has introduced me into the wonders of CSS, and through an <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/000521.html#000521" title="The 10 Habits of Highly Annoying Bloggers">entry</a> on <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/">Jeremy Zawodny's blog</a> found myself looking at Mark Pilgrim's excellent <a href="http://www.diveintoaccessibility.org/">Dive into Accessibility</a>.</p>
<p>First I must compliment Mark on providing such a detailed yet easily read and understood explanation of many of the accessibility issues faced on the Internet.  Second I must compliment Ben and Mena Trott of MovableType for implementing the majority of Mark's suggestions into verstion 2.6 of MT.  The only change I can remember making is the one on <a href="http://diveintoaccessibility.org/day_26_using_relative_font_sizes.html">Using relative font sizes</a>.</p>
<p>I highly recommend that all who are maintaining an information store on the web at least review the <a href="http://www.diveintoaccessibility.org/">Dive into Accessibility</a> site.</p>
