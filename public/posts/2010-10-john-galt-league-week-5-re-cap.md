<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>A timely and per my wife's criticism a bit spiced up recap of the JGL action from week 5.
<strong>Philadelphia Freeloaders (3-2) 86, Virginia Gentlemen (2-3) 85</strong></p>
<p>In a matchup where Vince Young outscored Matt Schaub by 13 points and Mike Tolbert outscored Arian Foster by 5 points there is no other way for it to end except by being decided by 1 point.  The worst part for Amy, manager of the Gentlemen, is that if she had not started a Defense she would have won the match.  But I agree that the Rams looked to be a great start against the Lions.</p>
<p><strong>Fairport Diehards (3-2) 85, Sedalia Seamonkeys (2-3) 78</strong></p>
<p>And Diana's Seamonkeys get exactly what they want out of Ray Rice, finally, but when your second leading scorer is your Kicker it's hard to finish with the W.  And running into an on-again Chris Johnson and hated (by me) Cowboy QB who was racking up points playing from behind meant that Tom Stone's Diehards took the win.  Both teams can look at the high bench production and play that age old Fantasy football game of second guessing yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Connecticut BNS Brawlers (3-2) 77, GeekPress Generals (3-2) 58</strong></p>
<p>The Brawlers victory gives me the opportunity to talk about my favorite subject and that is me winning fantasy football games.  Because his victory and mine came in lockstep due to the huge day by Malcom Floyd which necessitated a huge day by my QB.  Paul's Generals who have been solid all season, had the typical fantasy week where almost nothing goes right which was capped by Aaron Rodgers going down with a concussion at the end of the game.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ego Spengler (4-1) 69, Washington Oppressors (1-4) 53</strong></p>
<p>The good Dr. Spengler led by Mike King has been the most consistent JGLer over the past two years.  But this is ridiculous to get a victory where the top scorer is TE Marcedes Lewis with 17 is illegal, and I plan to use my commissioner powers to correct this miscarriage of Justice.  However I will insist that John Britely's Oppressors still retain their loss as well due to the fact that he snagged LeSean McCoy on waivers on Sunday morning when I am the one who's supposed to have the best player on my favorite team.  Unfortunately for the Oppressors in the best possible week to defeat the Ego got nothing from their team.</p>
<p><strong>Portland Agents Of Fortune (2-3) 109, Culver City Conmen (2-3) 88</strong></p>
<p>In true fantasy football fashion the Conmen have a solid week from many of their starters even with 4 players on BYE, but still manage to run into a team that had an even a better week.  As Brian Reich's Agents managed to put together huge numbers despite starting my least favorite Manning.  Yes I must admit Cooper is my favorite Manning.</p>
<p><strong>Rearden Steelers (5-0) 99, KC Money Barons (0-5) 74</strong></p>
<p>I am considering changing both of my daughters names to Philip Rivers as his consistency this season is the main reason I am 5 - 0, also a timely Falcons pickup before last weeks games helped me quite a bit here.  All I can say to Corey and his Money Barons is the winner of the league last year had a losing record, so anything can happen.  Also to illustrate this I'm 1 - 4 in the fantasy league my brother runs.</p>
