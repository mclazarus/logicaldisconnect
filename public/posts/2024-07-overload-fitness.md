I've been training here with John Parr for 7 years. I've just recently gotten my diet right and am down 42 lbs since February and I've never been stronger. Including that 18 year old football player I used to be. He definitely recovered faster than me and had better close range and low contrast vision. But I highly recommend SuperSlow training with John.
