<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>The laptop I acquired as a going away present from <a href="http://www.aspre.net">one</a> of my <a href="http://mcallister.ws/employment.html" title="Employment">previous employers</a> finally gave up the ghost.  It is a Dell Inspiron 5000e.  Got it working very nicely with RedHat, and the fact that it can do 1400x1050 is really nice.  It was even a suitable machine for playing <a href="http://www.unrealtournament.com/">Unreal Tournament</a></p>
<p>But anyway the motherboard seems to be shot, It won't progress from the BIOS POST screen any longer.  Luckily it has onsite support until October 2003.  So a Dell dispatched technician will be at my house today to replace the motherboard, CPU and <em>Thankfully</em> the cooling fan.  The fan in this machine has always rattled rather noisily, causing me great irritation.  So hopefully the light dusting of snow today won't keep Dell from their appointed rounds.</p>
