  <p>Well bad stuff happened in London.  :(
<a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/07/07/london.timeline/">timeline</a></p>
<p>Thankfully the UN stepped in:</p>
<blockquote><p>
5:49 The United Nations Security Council passes a resolution condemning the London attacks and expressing "outrage and indignation at today's appalling terrorist attacks against the people of the United Kingdom that cost human life and caused injuries and immense human suffering."
</p></blockquote>
<p>Good thing that's over with.  Seriously though is there any point to a resolution saying that something obviously bad is bad?  Also is there any point to this post?  Finally shouldn't something like this actually be on <a href="http://tom.mcallister.ws/away/">my brother's away message site</a> and not on mine?</p>
