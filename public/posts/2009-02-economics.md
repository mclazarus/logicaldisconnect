<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I've received word of a promising new blog focused on economics from an Objectivist point of view called [Simply Capitalism](http://www.simplycapitalism.com/2009/01/welcome-to-simply-capitalism.html).  It could prove a nice counterpoint of reason to the cacophony of shrill demands for increasing governmental control in our economic lives.  Subscribe to [their RSS feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/SimplyCapitalism) and see for yourself.</p>
