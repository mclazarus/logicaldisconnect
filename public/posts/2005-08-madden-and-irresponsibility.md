<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I can pick up Madden at midnight tonight, naturally I will.  And stay up until 3 or so playing, then I have a work call at 9 AM, that can't be postponed because it is with some people in Germany.
I am sure I won't be terribly useful on this call.  Unfortunately I have to do or manage all of the work that comes out of it.  :)</p>
<p>I wonder if GTD has any magic bullets for this case.</p>
<p>Guess I'll have to fire up some coke zeros.   I can't wait until caffeine is cheaper (i.e. it is winter and I can drink tea to get my fix)</p>
