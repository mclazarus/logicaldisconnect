<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I am sure there is already quite a bit of work on filtering the scumbag spam comments that get posted to popular weblog entries.  But now I have to try and figure out how to implement it.
In case it wasn't clear.  No one is welcome to utilize my software and computer resources to advertise their crap without my prior approval.  So bugger off!</p>
<p>Is there a SpamAssassin MT plugin?</p>
<p>Or is the solution much simpler?</p>
