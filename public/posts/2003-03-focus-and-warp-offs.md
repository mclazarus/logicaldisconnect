<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I just read an excellent  <a href="http://www.w-uh.com/articles/030308-tyranny_of_email.html" title="The Tyranny of Email">article</a> related to an <a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/500c727de4b0d820d6a42ad8/515f5893e4b0f7bed43ad1d5/515f59bbe4b0f7bed43ae738/1365203387053/000020.html?format=original">entry</a> I recently made, which was followed up by <a href="http://www.webcodefocus.com">Mike</a> <a href="">here</a>.</p>
<p>I tend to agree with the viewpoint that it takes 3 hours of individual concentration to get anything done (in general).  Although I, and my work, have benefitted significantly from interactive like work as Mike suggests, I think the 3 hours of uninterrupted focus suggested in the article, are a great way to get things done, as long as you can avoid what he calls "warp-offs."  Which is my key obstacle to overcome.  I think I am going to make a concerted effort to catch myself right before I do this, and take that energy and re-apply it to my work.  I may even keep a log for a few days so I can find what is usually the trigger of the warp-offs.  I guess this means no <a href="http://gaim.sf.net/">gaim</a>, no irc, and no <a href="http://www.mutt.org">email</a>.</p>
<p>Apparently before I got a chance to flesh out this entry, <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> got a hold of it and now the site is running a little slow.  But I swear I saw it first, on someone elses blog.  :-)</p>
