<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>If you use Gnome and want to do custom keyboard shortcuts, i.e. write your own script and have it executed when you hit a magic key combination, it is not as easy as going to the "Keyboard Shortcuts" preferences.  Apparently you gotta mess around with gconf (The linux registry?!), anyway after a short bit of google hunting I found this mailing list posting: <a href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-list/2004-June/msg00650.html" title="gnome custom keyboard shortcuts">Custom Keyboard Shortcuts in Gnome (Solved)</a>.  Thanks, Philip Chapman.</p>
