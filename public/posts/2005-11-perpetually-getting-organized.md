  <p>I have been trying to "get organized" since sometime in high-school when I was probably told to "buckle down."  Nothing seems to have taken very well, however.
The problem that I seem to have is two-fold.  First, every time I see a neat discussion or article or book on how to help you do stuff, I read it and get all fired up and start thinking about how to implement that philosphy.  Second I am letting the **best** destroy the good.  And I think this is the bigger of the two problems.</p>
<p><!--more--><lj -cut></p>
<p>Basically I start trying to plan out some structure that is used to capture the main things I need capturing, which anyone can tell you are a list of your projects.  A list of your next actions.  And some sort of calendar to capture the hard landscape of what is happening.  And finally a reliable reference file.  Where to store stuff you may need to reference later, reliably, in a form that is easy to look up.</p>
<p>Well as a guy who builds systems and programs this is a nightmare, I start thinking this is simple enough to build something.  Well it isn't, because all of the sudden I have something way more complex than the [37signals](http://37signals.com/) people have built, and it will take me a good 8 or 40 hours to put together.  And then I start thinking about backup, because hell if this is my life I better be able to back it up.  And of course I don't have time for this because while I am thinking about this I am shirking all kinds of other responsibilities, and the fires are growing all around me.  Then I run around for 3 days putting them out and long for an uninterrupted month where I can construct this super-duper life runner application.</p>
<p>Well I am a father, and I work, and I have hobbies, there is no uninterrupted month coming any time in the forseeable future, which I can't really see much of anyway because I am so busy running around putting out fires, or planning for the utopia in some distant future.  I really need to work on my middle game.</p>
<p>Anyway, starting today, I am going to errect a little bit of scaffolding to try and hold my life together.  I am going to spend about 10 minutes thinking about the simplest system that can possibly work.  </p>
<p>*I am picturing a calendar and a notebook.*</p>
<p>I think the biggest thing here is consistency of putting everything there, and to get in the habit of looking at it several times a day.  Maybe I can trick myself and write "email" or "bloglines" on the cover, since I typically look at both of those several times an hour.</p>
<p>I have to convince my brain that it doesn't have to be perfect to start using it.
