<p>Someone once told me that raising children would have good times and some rough times, but that the overall trend was always upward in his experience.  After 8 years and 4 months I am in full agreement with him.</p>

<p>And it's nothing huge that makes me say that.  I suspect it would probably qualify as boring or at least plain evening for lots of folks.  But I sat and read some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Astonishing-Whedon-Cassaday-Ultimate-Collection/dp/0785161945/logicaldiscon-20">X-Men comics</a> with Ashley and then sat and read a chapter of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Watership-Scribner-Classics-Richard-Adams/dp/1442444053/logicaldiscon-20">Watership Down</a> with Allison before they went to bed.  And this is the type of stuff I couldn't wait to do when they were born.  Share my interests, discuss the various characters ask and answer questions.  </p>

<p>It was a great night.</p>
