<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I just found out that Schneier is changing the format of Crypt-O-gram, for the better in my opinion.  He will now continuously post his articles in a blog format.  <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/">Schneier on Security</a>.  I have always liked reading the crypto-gram emails monthly, but sometimes it was a bit much to chew on all at once, and delayed my getting any work done on the 15th of the month for an extra hour or so while I digested the articles.  Anyway fire up <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a> and throw in the <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/index.rdf">RSS feed</a>.</p>
