  <p>The EPA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR), on July 11, 2008, [Regulating Greenhouse Gas Emissions under the Clean Air Act](http://epa.gov/climatechange/anpr.html).
Ordinarily this would be of passing interest to me.  But their own analysis shows that they will have to have control of **Everything** in order to handle this mandate, from Page 5 of the ANPR:
> EPA’s analyses leading up to this ANPR have increasingly raised questions of such importance that the scope of the agency’s task has continued to expand.  For instance, it has become clear that if EPA were to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles under the Clean Air Act, then regulation of smaller stationary sources that also emit GHGs – such as apartment buildings, large homes, schools, and hospitals – could also be triggered.  One point is clear:  **the potential regulation of greenhouse gases under any portion of the Clean Air Act could result in an unprecedented expansion of EPA authority that would have a profound effect on virtually every sector of the economy and touch every household in the land**. </p>
<p>This doesn't only include reaching into your home and setting your thermostat for you, or deciding how many cars you can own or what type of home or business you can build, it also extends to the food supply as commented by the USDA on page 67 of the ANPR:</p>
<p>> … many of the emissions are the result of natural biological processes that are as old as agriculture itself.  For instance, technology does not currently exist to prevent the methane produced by enteric fermentation associated with the digestive processes in cows and the cultivation of rice crops; the nitrous oxide produced from the tillage of soils used to grow crops; and the carbon dioxide produced 
by soil and animal agricultural respiratory processes.  **The only means of controlling such emissions would be through limiting production, which would result in decreased food supply and radical changes in human diets**.</p>
<p>This amount of control will effect you, this is not just an additional tax on the rich, or other such nonsense.  These are real proposals that will limit your ability to live your life.  The idea that carbon dioxide is a pollutant is factually wrong.  As a matter of fact high concentrations of CO2 are required for plant life, our food supply, to flourish.  Bureaucratic control of where you set your thermostat, or if you are allotted enough energy to take two hot showers a day, or what types of food you can purchase is absolutely antithetical to freedom and the life of humans who depend on their reason and judgment to survive.  </p>
<p>The EPA is now accepting feedback on this until November 11th.  Now is the opportunity to make your voice heard.</p>
<p>There is information on how to submit on the EPA site, or distilled along with example letters and arguments [here](http://www.classicalideals.com/EPA_Ruination.htm).</p>
