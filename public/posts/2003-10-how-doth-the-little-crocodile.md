  <p>How doth the little crocodileImprove his shining tail,
And pour the waters of the Nile
On every golden scale!</p>
<p>How cheerfully he seems to grin,
How neatly spreads his claws,
And welcomes little fishes in,
With gently smiling jaws!
- Lewis Carrol

<b>Against Idleness and Mischief</b>
How doth the little busy bee
Improve each shining hour,
And gather honey all the day
From every opening flower!</p>
<p>How skillfully she builds her cell!
How neat she spreads the wax!
And labours hard to store it well
With the sweet food she makes.</p>
<p>In works of labour or of skill,
I would be busy too;
For Satan finds some mischief still
For idle hands to do.</p>
<p>In books, or work, or healthful play,
Let my first years be passed,
That I may give for every day
Some good account at last 
- Isaac Watts</p>
