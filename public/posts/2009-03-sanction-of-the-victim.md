<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>It's a shame that the great business producers continue to sanction completely irresponsible government.  Read this in Warren Buffet's annual report for Berkshire Hathaway, Inc.
"Whatever the downsides may be, strong and immediate action by government was essential last year if 
the financial system was to avoid a total breakdown."</p>
<p>Since we all know that sacrificing the strong to pay for the mistakes of the weak and then pretending there wasn't an underlying problem always fixes everything.</p>
