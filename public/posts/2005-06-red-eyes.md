<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Travelling sucks.  I did have some good experiences though.  Thanks to Paul Zastoupil, of <a href="http://www.freeciv.org/">Freeciv</a> fame, for making me feel welcome and pointing me at Old City San Diego to get some food, see a touristy but nice part of San Diego, and get a gift for Allison.  If you find yourself in San Diego thats a good place to stop to grab something to eat and see a bunch of cheesy tourist shops.  It got me out of the vicious circle I had developed of going to the <a href="http://jackington.urbanup.com/1124303">Jackington</a> mall in La Jolla every day and marvelling at the knife shop and all the stores that wish they were The Gap.
Paul also hooked me up with some sweet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promotional_item">Schwag</a> which will require me to finish up Ratchet and Clank: Going Commando and Jak2 before using.  Thanks again!</p>
