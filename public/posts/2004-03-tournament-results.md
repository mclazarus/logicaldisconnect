  <p>The tournament was pretty cool.  And I saw people from my school (<a href="http://kickboxingcentral.com/">Villari's Trevose Studio</a>) do very well.  Congratulations Nick, Sheila, Steve and Chris who all left with a bunch of hardware.  Probably other representatives from my school did well also, I just didn't have time to notice, as I was also competing.
I came in second place in the "Forms" or "Katas" competition as it says on the tropy.  I was pleased with my performance, The form I did was called "3 Kata" and I felt I made a good showing of it.  I knew I had done well, because I wasn't conscience that  I was actually doing the form until I was about half way through.  The guy who came in first, in that competetion swept the adult green through brown stripe division.  I had the misfortune to draw him in the opening match of the sparring division.  I lost 5 - 3, I did disagree with the last point he was awarded (I felt I blocked it with two hands) but both judges agreed he should have had that point. However, I do know that he deserved to win that competition overall.</p>
<p>Overall it was a good time, and I am looking forward to competing again, for no other reason than to see quite a bit of cool things done, by a bunch of good martial artists.</p>
<p>Also congratulations to all who competed in the Villari's Pennsylvania Regional Martial Arts tournament.  I hope everyone enjoyed it as much as I did.  And I look forward to competing with many of you again.</p>
