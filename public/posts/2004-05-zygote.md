  <p>"A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygote">zygote</a> is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamete">gamete's</a> way of producing more gametes.  This may be the purpose of the Universe."  -Robert A. Heinlein
For those that don't already know, Michelle is now about 9 weeks pregnant.  Also for those who don't already know, how come we don't talk anymore...  But seriously, I'm gonna be a Daddy.</p>
<p>I am very excited, and slightly nervous or maybe nervous isn't the right word, it is more a feeling of awareness.  I am slightly more aware of things that I need to do to improve myself, to prepare for the coming of my child.</p>
<p>I just hope I can do for my child a mere fraction of the wonderful life my parents provided for me.  
Thanks again, Michelle, for making my life even more amazing.</p>
