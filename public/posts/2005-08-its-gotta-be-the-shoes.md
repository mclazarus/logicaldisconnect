<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I have been on a real walking kick since I have been working from home.  In the past 10 days or so I have walked at least 2 to 3 miles daily and some days I have walked over 5 to 6 miles.  And over the past 2 months there haven't been more than maybe 7 total days that I didn't walk at all.
The last 7 days have been particularly intense with longer trips and more hills.  I have noticed some muscle soreness, which is good and is something I am used to, however I have also noticed some pain that I don't think should be there.  My right foot hurts around the arch, and yesterday I noticed another pain in my right calf that was unusual, my initial thought was I must be compensating from the pain in my foot and altering my gait, therefore causing a different pain to happen.</p>
<p>Anyway what it comes down to is I think my shoes may have had it, (New Balance 475) that I got for Christmas last year.  But they aren't terribly worn so I hate to throw them away and get new ones.  So here are my questions:</p>
<p>1. anyone have experience, recomendations of the various sole inserts, particularly for walking quite a bit?
2. anyone have a favorite brand of comfortable shoes that stand up to quite a bit of walking?
3. Any other suggestions for foot/shoe care?</p>
