<p>Green Bay police are on the lookout for a monkey named Jasper, who they say isn't armed but might be dangerous.  Jasper dashed out the back door of a tavern where he and his owner are regulars, Lt. Mark Hellmann said Monday.  Hellmann described Jasper as small, dark and hairy, but didn't know what species he is.  The police department's humane officer said Jasper may try to harm people if he's scared and advised anyone who sees him use caution.</p>
