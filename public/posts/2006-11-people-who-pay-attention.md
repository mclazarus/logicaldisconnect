  <p>Although apparently packed with losers <a href="http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2006/11/are_smart_peopl.html">Mensa does have one charming quality according to Scott Adam's</a></p>
<p>
<blockquote>Mensa meetings are the strangest experience. No one ever has to explain anything twice. That’s a bigger deal than you might think. Your typical day is full of moments where you ask for a cup of coffee and someone hands you a bag of nails. You don’t realize how much time you spend re-explaining things until you no longer need to. Mensa is very cool that way.</p></blockquote>

It would be great to have people pay attention to you the first time.  I would say I spend a very large part of my day not only repeating myself, but reciting from memory the contents of emails I had sent, and recounting the detail in voicemail that I left for people.</p>
