<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>If you car won't start and you need to get it towed somewhere, AAA doesn't have a hard time hearing you tell them where you are, when you say.  I'm home.  Instead of at mile 237 on the turnpike.
Another advantage is, it doesn't matter much if the shop can't look at it today, because, well you weren't going anywhere tomorrow anyway.</p>
<p>Oh, and I hate my car currently.</p>
</div>
