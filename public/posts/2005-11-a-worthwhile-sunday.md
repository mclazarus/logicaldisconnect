<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>So far so good today.  I finally isolated the bad part on my laptop.  (Allison spilled a large cup of water on it a couple months ago).  I tried booting with a linux CD and noticed that the resulting kernel panic mentioned some errors relating to the VM system.  So I decided to use memtest on the Knoppix disc.  And stopped it at around 13,000 errors at just above 128 MB.  So I pulled out the soDIMM in slot 2 and it booted.  My new memory should be here Wednesday.  :)  It gives me an excuse to squeeze a little more life out of this laptop, by bumping the memory to 512, from 256.
And I have two worthwhile 1PM NFL games to watch for the first time in a million years.  Probably because the Jets play tonight, god I hate watching Jets games.</p>
