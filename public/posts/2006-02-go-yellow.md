<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>GM has been bombarding my television with ads saying that they are hard at work to save the world by ending our dependence on petroleum.  While I must say that I respect work to provide a renewable energy source.  I find the tone of the commercials funny.  I mean sure it would be great to drive a car that can run on old corn cobs and left over beer, but unless GM is running around retrofitting the corn farms equipment to not use giant oil guzzling machines we surely aren't ending any kind of petroleum dependence.
I mean the exposure is great and GM should be applauded for using some of the hours and hours and hours of commercial time they buy each year to raise awareness of alternative fuel sources.  But everyone should just think for a minute to know what they are buying into.</p>
