<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Well after the unprecedented .3 release in the 7.X line of <a href="http://www.redhat.com/">RedHat Linux</a> it appears they are skipping right over .1 and .2 in the 8.X line.  I recieved a message today saying that since I am a subscriber to the <a href="https://rhn.redhat.com/">RedHat Network</a> I will be able to get <a href="http://www.redhat.com/mktg/rh9iso/">RedHat 9</a> on March 31st. </p>
<p>So does the standard advice of don't use a .0 release for RedHat, which I have often recieved, apply to this 9.0 release?  Should I continue using 7.3?  Is this jump to 9.0 along with their recent announcement of their <a href="http://www.redhat.com/software/rhel/">RedHat Enterprise Linux</a>, just evidence that the <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/entry/marketroid.html">marketroids</a> are taking over.</p>
<p>Just in case you wonder, both my desktop and my laptop are running 8.0 and I have been generally pleased.  It is very pretty.  I have also heard from a few that have upgraded to <a href="http://gnome.org/start/2.2/">Gnome 2.2</a> from RedHats <a href="http://lwn.net/1998/0820/rawhide.html">Rawhide</a> that they are quite pleased with the enhancements, and claim it is even more complete.  So I will be taking advantage of my subscription to download the 9.0 isos, and promptly installing.</p>
<p>Maybe someone with bandwidth to burn would let me upload the 9.0 isos to their server, once I grab them?</p>
