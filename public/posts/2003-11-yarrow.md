<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>The <a href="http://rhl.redhat.com/">RedHat Linux Project</a>, now called the <a href="http://fedora.us/">Fedora Project</a>, has recently put out the first release of <a href="http://fedora.redhat.com/docs/release-notes/">Fedora Core</a>.  I guess you might be tempted to call this RedHat 10, or 9.1 or something, but I like this movement in redhat opening up the development process in this project.  It should get me my fancy newer software faster, and I am more likely to be able to find an RPM for something.
I am going to be installing Yarrow (the new release name) tonight on my work laptop.  So hopefully the 2GHz, 512 MB machine can handle all the fancy widgets and colors of Gnome 2.4.</p>
