<p>Once I had children and continued to fill my life with values, it
became difficult to make the time to read even though I've loved
reading as long as I can remember. Then I discovered
<a href="http://audible.com/">Audible</a> and it was love of books and not music that drove
me to buy my first iPod in 2005.  </p>

<p>Today I still do most of my fiction reading using Audible since I can
do it during my commute, washing dishes, or any other mostly-mindless
home maintenance task.  So if you aren't using Audible, I whole
heartedly recommend signing up and taking advantage of their free
trials.</p>

<p>This post is really for people who already are using Audible.</p>

<p>They currently are running a <a href="http://www.audible.com/mt/SuperSciFi_ALL">Super Sci-Fi Sale</a> Through the end of
the day May 10, 2014, where they have over 100 books available for
$6.95 each.  I paged through like I do many of their sales and found
they had a number of books I want or that I've read and enjoyed and wanted
to dash off something quick to recommend to others.</p>

<p>So here is the list, some of these I've read.  Others are on my
wishlist or I recognize the authors and think they might be worth
looking at.  Other than that grouping they are in no particular order:</p>

<h2 id="read">Read</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/Assignment-in-Eternity-Audiobook/B007XU32MS">Assignment in Eternity</a>, Robert A. Heinlein: I always recommend
everything Heinlein wrote, plus this was narrated by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balki_Bartokomous">Balki</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/A-Canticle-for-Leibowitz-Audiobook/B005F5ZBRC">A Canticle for Leibowitz</a>, Walter Miller: good classic
SciFi, read it years ago on advice of my father and enjoyed it.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/The-Mote-in-Gods-Eye-Audiobook/B002V5GWHM/">Diplomatic Immunity: A Miles Vorkosigan Novel</a>, Lois McMaster
Bujold: The Vorkosigan saga is very enjoyable.  This is book 14 in
the series so you have quite a bit of work to catch up to it, but
you might as well grab this one inexpensively now!  This is not one
of those series that I suffer from sunk costs, I liked each book.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Classics/Frankenstein-Audiobook/B00FQRCM9O">Frankenstein</a>, Mary Shelley: A classic.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/Little-Fuzzy-Audible-Audiobook/B002V0A8PE">Little Fuzzy</a>, H. Beam Piper: I actually listened to the version of this that came with <a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/Fuzzy-Nation-Audiobook/B004YXLK7G">Fuzzy Nation</a>, John Scalzi and I hated the Scalzi retelling of the story, but found the original Piper version to be a much better telling, where the Scalzi story was crude and obvious and pumped full of a certain political view that all corporations and any selfishness is evil, the Piper story suffered none of this and actually told an interesting story.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/Reamde-Audiobook/B005PMU12U">Reamde</a>, Neal Stephenson: I thankfully never got hooked on World of Warcraft, but got to enjoy machine guns and intrigue surrounding a video game world in this book. It was crazy at times, but I enjoyed it.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/The-Dreaming-Void-Audiobook/B002V0PW2I">The Dreaming Void: Void Trilogy Book 1</a>, Peter F. Hamilton: I listened to the <a href="http://www.audible.com/series/ref=a_pd_Sci-Fi_c2__1_sa?asin=B006K1M4YI">Commonwealth Saga</a> and <a href="http://www.audible.com/series/ref=a_pd_Sci-Fi_c2__1_sa?asin=B006K1NGAE">The Void Trilogy</a> and recommend them both.  I'd probably listen to the Commonwealth Saga first, but you can start here if you'd like.  I think this is what they call a space opera, and I approve.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/The-Lost-Fleet-Dauntless-Audiobook/B002VAGN62">The Lost Fleet: Dauntless</a>, Jack Campbell: The Lost Fleet series was another long series that if you like space nerdery, is awesome.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="haventread">Haven't Read</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/Beowulfs-Children-Audiobook/B009NICUEY">Beowulf's Children</a>, Larry Niven, Jerry Pournelle, Steven
Barnes: I haven't read this, but read something else by Larry Niven
and Jerry Pournelle called <a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/The-Mote-in-Gods-Eye-Audiobook/B002V5GWHM">The Mote in God's Eye</a> and
enjoyed it so I think this one is probably worth a shot.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/With-the-Lightnings-Audiobook/B002V5B9Z2">With the Ligtnings: RCN Series, Book 1</a>, David Drake: I think I picked this up on a reliable friends recommendation, just haven't gotten around to it yet.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/Stealing-Light-Shoal-Book-1-Audiobook/B008O7DNOG">Stealing Light: Shoal, Book 1</a>, Gary Gibson: In my wishlist and recommended to me, haven't had a chance to pick it up yet.  Probably will here.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/Firestar-Audiobook/B009UX3Y60">Firestar: Firestar Saga, Book 1</a>, Michael Flynn: Another in my wishlist and I'm not sure who recommeneded it.  But I'll probably grab this one here too.</li>
</ul>
