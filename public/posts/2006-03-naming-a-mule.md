<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Imagine if you will a middle aged man, mild mannered by day, but by weekend he is a drug mule, pulling up stakes from his family life and shooting down to that hot bed of drug activity, Virginia!  Bringing back automobiles made entirely of cocaine.  Described as quirky or old fashioned mostly, but he knows the score.  The question is, what is the street name for this character?</p>
