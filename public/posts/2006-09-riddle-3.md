<p>#2's easy and obvious answer was of course "a River" I took some heat for making it too easy, but once you know they answer to one it always seems easy and obvious.  This seems very easy to me, but I hope it's a little more challenging.</p>
<p>I have been enjoying the fact that people actually bother to answer these.  I am going to try and consistently put some up here.  If you have any you want to share send them to mclazarus@gmail.com</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
