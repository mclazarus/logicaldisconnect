  <p>Well Tuesday mornings should be very productive for me in 2006 during football season.  They just announced that the Monday Night Football crew will be Al Michaels and Joe Theisman.  UGH!  Theisman is the worst announcer ever.
Anyway, like I said it's a mixed blessing, I can go to sleep early on Monday, and when the Eagles play I can just listen to Merrill Reese.</p>
