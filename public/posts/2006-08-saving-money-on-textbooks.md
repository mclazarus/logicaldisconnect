  <p>I am pretty proud about the way I have saved money on texts in college, and I bug people with the stories often.  Recently I saw a chance to share this with the world because the folks at <a title="Lifehacker" href="http://lifehacker.com/">lifehacker</a> <a title="Cheap Textbooks" href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/back-to-school/ask-the-readers--cheap-textbooks-197494.php">asked about it</a>, so I sent them the email, got my invite to comment and commented.  But decided I would throw the same tips and stuff up here, because, well as I said I am proud of them.  So if you are looking for ways to stick it to the man when it comes to college textbooks, read on.
<!--more--> There are lots of ways to save money on textbooks, clearly using
firefox plugins like <a href="http://bookburro.org/">bookburo</a> are top of the list, but
here is how I saved before it was as easy to find inexpensive books
for sale on the net.</p>
<p>First realize there are three types of books, ones you want to keep,
ones you want only for the class at hand, and ones that are totally
unecessary to do well in the class and the professor just threw it on
to his list as it would help explain some concepts more deeply.  (Sure
you are there to learn primarily, but ya gotta have money to eat)</p>
<p>With that realization your first thing to do is find out from the
professor his plans for the book, if they are really optional then
don't bother buying it, or share with a friend or group of friends.</p>
<p>Okay, now we are at the point of books you need and you either want
them or only want them to use for the class.  So books you want, find
the best price using the internet or finding upperclassman or alumni
who have an older version or even the current version of some timeless
texts.</p>
<p>Now the interesting part, books you need temporarily, first verify it
isn't at your colleges library, if it is, you are set, borrow it and
if necessary pay the late fees at the end of the semester if it lasts
longer than your renewals will take you.  $2.50 for the rental of a
$80 book for 15 weeks is a nice savings.</p>
<p>If your school library doesn't have it, check local public libraries,
you will be suprised what some carry.  Again late fees can be
justified in the overall goal of saving money.  If you get no luck
there check if your school has relationships with other school
libraries, these may get you access to the library but not the ability
to take out the book.  You can now decide if it is worth an
underhanded trick.  You can hope the book will be there each time you
return to study or do your homework.  Or you can find a hiding place
in the library where you can retreive the book but prevent the other
schools students from checking it out.  This is up to your own ethics
on how you feel about this tactic, but it will save you money.</p>
<p>Finally there is ILL or Inter-Library Loan.  Your school library or
even public library may have the ability to borrow books on your
behalf and lend them to you from a very large number of sources.  If
you can find the book put in the request.  You usually can't get these
for terribly long, but depending on the professors strategy with the
text you just have to put your request in at the right time and you
may have it for the time you need it.  There is also the concept of
extending the borrowing, and finally late fees here can be much less
expensive than the actually book.</p>
<p>One of the keys to all of these strategies is timing.  You need to be
on the ball for any of these things to work, otherwise your classmates
will beat you to the punch.</p>
