  <p>The January 21st New York Times article, "[How Green is my Orange?](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/22/business/22pepsi.html?_r=2)"reveals the environmentalists most holy sacrament.  </p>
<p>The article shows giants of production, like [PepsiCo](http://www.pepsico.com/), are sacrificing their time and
ability calculating and reducing carbon emissions in an attempt to
avoid being a victim of governmental mandates.  </p>
<p>You may wonder at the
nature of the atrocity committed by PepsiCo that would require
governmental retribution and demands such atonement.  They are
cowering in fear because they have committed the only mortal sin
recognized by environmentalists, they produce life sustaining
nourishment for man.  While their efforts at reconciliation are to be
applauded, they are insufficient.  </p>
<p>The highest virtue and grace of
environmentalism can only be achieved by the complete sacrifice of man
and his values to the pure untouched wilds of nature.</p>
