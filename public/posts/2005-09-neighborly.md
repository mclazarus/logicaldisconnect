<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Dear annoying loud neighbor who has decided to spend the last two days on your front step having loud conversations,
What's wrong with the inside of your house?  (Except, of course, that you are usually in there.)</p>
<p>Sincerely,
The committee for a you free neighborhood</p>
</div>
