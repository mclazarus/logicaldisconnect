  <p>This site has languished because there was absolutely no purpose or reason for it.  I have spent some time and decided a few reasons for continuing it, and have thus renewed my interest in maintaining and updating it.  The below reasons are published here and on the site's <a href="/colophon">colophon</a> for newcomers to understand the purpose.
<!--more--></p>
<p>Previously Logical Disconnect served as a diary of rants and various diatribes of no particular purpose and with no cohesive theme.  Often it had, as most blogs, come off as complaints and sometimes information that was too personal to be of much use to anyone even those who know me.  Primarily it was a personal outlet for unformed notions I wanted to share but with no one in particular.  </p>
<p>In some sense the personal nature will continue, however, I have <a href="/logical-disconnect-1/archives/2008/06/26/coming-soon">recently</a> decided to use the writing here as a means to further my study of <a href="http://www.aynrand.org/">Objectivism</a>.  </p>
<p>My plan is to use it to write in order to learn.  It became explicit to me when listening to <a href="http://www.peikoff.com/">Dr. Leonard Peikoff's</a> lecture series <a href="http://www.aynrandbookstore2.com/prodinfo.asp?number=LP01M">The Philosophy of Education</a> that writing is a tremendously valuable cognitive tool.  It forces you to slow down your thought process and make well reasoned arguments.  If you don't want the concrete, the writing, to be utter nonsense then you must understand and mentally organize the subject.  And by doing this it requires you to integrate the concepts, you wish to write about, into your own hierarchy of knowledge.  To really understand the ideas in order to convey them.  This is to be part of my defense against any kind of dogmatism or other irrationality in my study of philosophy.</p>
<p>This is analogous to the "trick" I used in college to give focus to study.  When it became generally well known that I was doing well, I was often asked for help by other students in my classes.  By agreeing to help others I was required to understand the material well enough to convey it to them.  And if you have ever tried to teach, especially someone who is honestly seeking to learn, you can't fake this understanding.  After spending time teaching the concepts to others, my understanding of the material was unshakable.  This activity greatly focused my effort and diminished my need for additional independent study.  </p>
<p>By making the writing public I could be subject to criticism or counterarguments which may help me refine my ideas.  It will provide additional context to those I have been having frequent philosophic discussions with recently.  And will also further my wife's growing understanding that she has chosen a very unique individual to share life with.</p>
<p>I also plan to use the writing here as a tool for introspection and as a secondary value I would like my children to be able to have this as a concrete reference for knowing about their Father.  I know reading a copy of a single letter I discovered, which my father wrote years ago at work[1] gave me a different and unexpected perspective and even greater admiration for him.  </p>
<p>Yes this is a very selfish motive and personal collection of articles.  I intend to derive great value from writing them.</p>
<p>1. Yes letter, not email.  I said years ago. </p>
