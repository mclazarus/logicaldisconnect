<p>One of my favorite <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w">podcasts</a> spent their <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/78">whole show</a> talking about this article.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Get comfortable with the idea that you won’t know what’s good until it’s already happened.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's a very good article on working when you don't have any idea what your doing.</p>

<p>It's convinced me that I should be listening to the whole back catalog of <a href="http://www.radiolab.org">Radiolab</a>.</p>
