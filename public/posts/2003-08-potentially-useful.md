<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I have recently come across a new project called <a href="http://www.wikitravel.org">WikiTravel</a>.  It is intended to be a collaborative and freely available travel guide.  It is just getting started so there is not much information available at this point.  But I think this could be really useful.  I mean I use the <a href="http://wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> almost every day to look up some information, and it is starting to get really good.  And of course <a href="http://everything2.com/">Everything2</a> uses a somewhat similar model for collaborative information sharing.  And both of those resources have quite a bit of good information there, but without the authors who contribute their work, there would be nothing.  I can see a great use for the vision of this WikiTravel guide so it would be interesting if it can succeed.  So the point is, go to <a href="http://www.wikitravel.org">WikiTravel</a> and <a href="http://www.wikitravel.org/article/Wikitravel:Plunge_forward">Plunge Forward</a>, you probably have quite a bit of interesting stuff to share be it about your hometown or about the exotic place you just visited.  I guess I should find some time to write about my recent trip to Disney.</p>
