<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Today I learned that sometimes if you wait long enough your problem goes away.  Actually I always knew that, but this was in a positive way.  I kept assuming something wasn't working when in reality it was just taking longer to get an IP address than it should have.  But what's 7 minutes among friends.</p>
<p>I also learned that budgeting and paying your bills is a good thing.  I wasn't behind on anything, but boy did I owe a lot of money.  Expensive wifely birthday presents, children being born, Fantasy leagues being financed and car inspections all conspired to beat me senseless financially.</p>
<p>
Now I am going to take a shot at following the simple budgeting advice at <a href="http://www.gettingfinancesdone.com/blog/archives/2006/08/how-to-create-a-zero-based-budget/">Getting Finances Done</a>.</p>
