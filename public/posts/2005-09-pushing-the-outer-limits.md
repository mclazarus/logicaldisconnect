<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I walk!  And it is good for listening, relaxing and exercising.  But I find I always have to push the limit on my range.  Today I am going to walk to the Barnes & Noble in Willow Grove, which [looks to be](http://tinyurl.com/9ccy4) just over 2 miles one way.  I'll try and find a book for around $16 (this will make it virtually free, with coupons, discounts and store credit).  I'll get some food somewhere along the way, and walk back.
Earlier this week it took me 22 minutes to walk to the mall, So I expect about 1 hour 15 minutes walking time.</p>
