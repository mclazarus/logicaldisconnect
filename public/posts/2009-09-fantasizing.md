<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I'm in four fantasy football leagues this year.
One is the real deal, the league I've been in with my wife for what seems like 3 or so years every year, but undoubtedly it's been at least 7 years, the TMCFL run by <a href="http://tom.mcallister.ws/">my brother</a>, on a <a href="http://fanball.com/">site</a> that is getting increasingly crappy since being acquired by an NBC Sports affiliate.  </p>
<p>The other is the <a href="http://www.dianahsieh.com/blog/2009/08/john-galt-league.shtml">John Galt League</a>, where I am the acting commisioner, brought together by the common fact that we all are fans of Diana Hsieh's blog <a href="http://www.dianahsieh.com/blog/index.shtml">NoodleFood</a>.  </p>
<p>I also have played in <a href="http://ryangrier.com/">Ryan Grier's</a> league for the past few years where I tend to be terrible.  </p>
<p>And finally as always I picked up a Yahoo public league in order to practice drafting before the TMCFL, although given the awesomeness of the ESPN mock drafts I may stop that after this year.</p>
<p>I am currently fantasizing the fame, fortune and prestige of winning both the JGL and the TMCFL as I watched my Eagles whup an overmatched Panthers and noticed my top pick in both of those leagues, Adrian Peterson, racking up the points.  I am now convinced that he will score at least 3 touchdowns every week and I will dominate all of the competition.  </p>
<p>Stay tuned for too frequent updates of my fantasy prowess or complete silence if my team collapses into disarray.</p>
