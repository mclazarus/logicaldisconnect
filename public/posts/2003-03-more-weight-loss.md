  <p>Well it begins again.  I decided to allocate April, May and possibly June to achieving my second round of weight loss goals.  So I need to string together a bunch of days at the gym and be really particular about the food I eat.</p>
<p>Starting November 17, 2001 I decided to lose weight, I was about 300 lbs on that day.  Sometime in mid-May 2002 I got down to 218.5.  I have been between 215.0 and 225.0 since then.  With my wedding coming up (July 12), I decided to peel the rest of my now not so massive gut off, so my goal is 195.0 - 199.0.  Today I am 220.5, and headed to the gym.</p>
<p>To see a comparison of pictures go to <a href="http://mcallister.ws/weightloss.html">weight-loss.</a>  I have a bunch more pictures that may show it more clearly, and I will eventually get around to putting them up there, but you can definitely see it in my face there.  And if you want to loose weight, try <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/">The Hacker's Diet</a>, following the ideas discussed in there worked for me.  Although my exercise routine was a bit of a departure from his, but it was still the same general idea.</p>
