<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I have been going through a rough patch based on the health of my father recently.  That combined with the hectic schedule at <a href="http://www.centraview.com/">CentraView</a> has limited my expression here for a short while.</p>
<p>While talking with my father someone said to him: <q>You're tough, you get better now.</q>  And his response showed, what I can only  very inaccurately call, true toughness and expressed one of the underlying principles of how life should be lived:</p>
<p><q>Tough's got nothing to do with it.  This is how it is, you deal with it.</q></p>
<p>My father is a great inspiration and the source of much of my life outlook.  His example of how he lives his life is worth more to me than almost anything else I have been able to experience.  Thank you, Dad, and get well soon.</p>
