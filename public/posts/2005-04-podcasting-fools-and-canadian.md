  <p>Why does google think I am in Canadian.  When I am at work and go to google.com it automatically sends me to <a href="http://www.google.ca/">Google Canada</a>.  I know Jersey is a little strange, but I didn't know we (the US) were shipping them off to be some other countries problem.
Apparently it's All Fool's day as evidenced by all the half assed Slashdot stories and the whole assed <a href="http://www.google.com/googlegulp/">Google Gulp</a> product announcement.</p>
<p>I guess with it being a Friday I will have to read the the joke RFC too.  <strong>Side note</strong>: If you try really really hard to tell a joke and it really is only mildly amusing, does it still count as a joke?</p>
<p>Also I downloaded <a href="http://ipodder.sf.net/">ipodder</a> last night and grabbed a few <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast">podcasts</a> to listen to on the travel to and from work.  Mildly interesting, I guess at least as good as some of the commercial radio around here.  The only problem is the people tend to not have a very strict agenda and digress into really boring topics or inside jokes, it's like college radio where all they talk about is how cool it is to be able to communicate over this wonderous medium that is radio.  "And here we are voices coming to you through the air, isn't radio great!  I wish everone would do this."</p>
<p>Although I think an hour long podcast of just the little 5 - 10 second self-promotional rock and roll intros with ominous voiceovers that each caster inevitably makes for themselves would be fun to hear.  It would be like just hearing that little segment of the Rob Zombie song Howard uses to launch his show every day, over and over.  (Yeah I know, I am the only one driving around at 6 that hears this.  But it sounds cool.)  Seriously I think most of the people doing podcasting probably wanted to do it, just because they always liked this really cool part of some song wanted to have it as their intro music, much like the WWE wrestlers have, or that episode of the family guy when Peter wished for theme music to follow him around all the time.</p>
