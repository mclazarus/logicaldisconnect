<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Inspired by [my brother's](http://tom.mcallister.ws/) [NFL season preview](http://tom.mcallister.ws/2005/09/08/nfl-season-overview-commentary-on-all-32-teams/), I am going to strive to be more concise in my explanations, descriptions and opinion expression.  From what I can see it brings more interesting response, and sure you will be misinterpreted, but at least you will know people read what you wrote.
I know many of my work related emails have been skimmed and archived, because, who has the time.</p>
