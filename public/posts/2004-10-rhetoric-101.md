  <p><strong>Background</strong>: My brother, Tom, is teaching a college freshman rhetoric course and has recently shown <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361596/">Farhenheit 9/11</a> in his class and apparently asked for some sort of reaction paper to be written.  There also was a paper comparing the rhetorical techniques of Gandhi and Malcom X.
Seen in Tom's away message:</p>
<blockquote><p>
In grading student papers over the weekend, I've learned the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's not fair to remove a president from office before he finishes a war he's started.</li>
<li>The war on Iraq was unjust, the president doesn't seem qualified, and the facts presented in "Fahrenheit 9/11" are disturbing, but it's unpatriotic to question the president and wrong to vote against him.</li>
<li>Gandhi was a "coward and a suck-up" and "soft" </li>
<li>During the 1960s, "some slavery" was beginning to be abolished.</li>
<li>Americans never get to hear Bush's side of the story</li>
<li>Direct quotes: "you are a liar" (to me), and "Michael Moore can eat *&@!"</li>
<li>Gandhi is more like a "Care Bear" than Malcolm X</li>
<li>It's "fucking awesome" that Bush was a cocaine addict and alcoholic</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Those are the building blocks of some fine arguments.</p>
