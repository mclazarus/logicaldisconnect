<p>The current regime's terrorist propoganda has spawned the <acronym title="fear uncertainty and doubt">FUD</acronym> promoting site <a href="http://ready.gov/">Ready.gov</a>.  Fear mongering at its best.</p>
<p> Luckily there are great generic images there that have been appropriated for the purposes of comedy.  Apparently adding new captions is highly entertaining and fun.  You can see a bunch of this at the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/6egk">Internet Infidels Discussion</a>.</p>
