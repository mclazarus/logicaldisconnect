<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>tomorrow a little before 5 AM I will be hitting the road to go to the IC and see what passes for fun there for a few action packed days while I help my <a href="http://tom.mcallister.ws/">brother</a> pack all his posessions into a little steel box to be shipped to somewhere in Jersey, watch him officially get his Master of Fine Arts in Writing or English or something.  Check out $3 car-bombs, and fly back to Philly while he drives so I can resume work on ye olde dungeon, also known as my new "study."
Look forward to a flury of pic postings here using flickr's interface and my Samsung a900.</p>
