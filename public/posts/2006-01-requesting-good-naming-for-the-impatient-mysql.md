<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I guess I am impatient, and I don't want to read everything, and therefore I demand of people that effect my life choose good names for stuff.  The current complaint is about MySQL's privilege system.  [Apparently](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/4.1/en/grant.html) USAGE privilege is a synonym for âno privileges.â?
Any reason, why this can't simply be NONE, or "TOO FEW PRIVILEGES TO BOTHER MENTIOING" or anything besides a word that makes it look like something?</p>
<p>Yes I get the low level irony of me claiming to be impatient and taking the time to write this rant.  But if you think about it, I have now seared this into my memory with this 5 minute interlude.</p>
