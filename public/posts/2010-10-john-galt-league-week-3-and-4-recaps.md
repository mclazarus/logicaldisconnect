  <p>Now working to finally catch up on my fantasy recaps I got through weeks 3 and 4 and am making a personal vow to get week 5 in early this week.
<strong>Week 3 recap</strong></p>
<p><strong>Virginia Gentlemen 116, Culver City Conmen 109</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>In week 3 the Conmen put up a solid 109 with good
performances from most of their players.  Only the
Patriots D (1) and Matt Forte (3) underperforming.
Unfortunately their opponent the Virginia Gentlemen had
great performances particularly 31 from Adrian Peterson
who ran all over the Lions.  Here the Conmen were handed
their first loss.  This was the Gentlemen's first win.</p>
<p><strong>Fairport Diehards 106, Connecticut BNS Brawlers 73</strong></p>
<p>A huge game by Anquan Boldin, and great performances by
Romo and Chris Johnson vaulted the Diehards to a win over
the Brawlers despite their Cedric Benson's big week and
Mike Wallace having a huge game down in Tampa.  The
Brawlers unfortunately left Peyton Hillis on the bench
for his huge game not having to share any carries with
Jerome Harrison and LeSean McCoy had his worst game of
the season so far.</p>
<p><strong>Sedalia Sea Monkeys 65, KC Money Barons 51</strong></p>
<p>The Money Barons continue to have a hard time
manufacturing points where Colston, Celek, DeAngelo
Williams and Steve Smith (Carolina) are all not producing
consistent with where they needed to be drafted.  Drew
Brees is the only bright spot this week as the Barons
fall to 0 - 3.  The Sea Monkeys get a huge game from
Dustin Keller and manage to scrape together enough points
to top the Barons bringing them to 1- 2.</p>
<p><strong>GeekPress Generals 114, Portland Agents Of Fortune 66</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong> The Generals put up big performances from Collie,
Mendenhall, Rogers and the Steelers Defense to post huge
numbers in week 3, which was more than enough to top the
Agents of Fortune who aside from Michael Vick and Steven
Jackson couldn't get anyone else in double digits.  The
pair of Calvin Johnson and Larry Fitz who strike fear in
the heart of fantasy opponents continue to frustrate.</p>
<p><strong>Washington Oppressors 75, Philadelphia Freeloaders 59</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The Oppressors had solid performances from Turner,
Charles, Bowe and Cutler riding the Chiefs 3 - 0 record
and overcoming a bad outing by their Bucs defense to
their first win of the season.  The Freeloaders who
grabbed the Chiefs defense and were rewarded by a good
game were hurt by their reliance on the Houston passing
game and Schaub, Walter and Andre Johnson that didn't
post big numbers this week.</p>
<p><strong>Rearden Steelers 105, Dr. Ego Spengler 92</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>In a high scoring matchup the Steelers got good performances from Rivers, Maclin, Bradshaw and their newly added Cardinals D, to offset strong performances from Peyton, LT and DeSean Jackson.  Luckily the Chiefs were able to hold Frank Gore down to 14 points and help the Steelers to their 3 - 0 record and hand Dr. Spengler his only loss.</p>
<p>Additionally the Steelers are 3 - 0 against doctors this season.</p>
<p><strong>Week 4</strong>
The First week of byes, which leads to all sorts of scarcity and fun in trying to decide who to start or pickup.</p>
<p><strong>GeekPress Generals (3 - 1) 87, Culver City Conmen (2 - 2) 79</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>In week 4 the Conmen had a solid performance from their
Defense but put up goose-eggs from the Moss tandem at WR
as Washington had success running on my Eagles and had no
reason to even look at Santana and Randy was on the outs
in New England.  Two zeros in a line up when playing a
consistently solid GeekPress Generals usual spells
disaster and this week it made the Conmen fall to 2 and 2.</p>
<p><strong>Philadelphia Freeloaders (2 - 2) 66, Fairport Diehards (2- 2) 57</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Oddly the second game of the week where a team posted nil
from the wide receivers, but in this case they managed to
win as the Freeloaders got solid performances from Mike
Tolbert, Matt Schaub and Zack Miller.  And the Diehards
were only able to get double-digit points from Flacco and
Ryan Matthews as Denver was able to hold Chris Johnson to
only 4 points</p>
<p><strong>Virginia Gentlemen (2 - 2) 106, Connecticut BNS Brawlers (2 - 2) 74</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>And you can tell it's a bye week as yet another team
manages to post a pair of zeroes, but even more
impressively the Gentlemen still manage to put out 106
points as they are the top scorer this week.  Helped by a
combined 56 points from Antonio Gates and Arian Foster
(who took 1 quarter off for missing a team meeting).  The
Brawlers who did have some solid performances from Carson
Palmer and Peyton Hillis but also had the misfortune of
running into the 2nd highest scoring team in the league.</p>
<p><strong>Sedalia Sea Monkeys (2 - 2) 90, Washington Oppressors (1 - 3) 46</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The Sea Monkeys continue to get good performances from
Dustin Keller and finally their other players posted some
solid numbers as well as they finally hit on a QB that
was going to give solid numbers as Sanchez put up 14 and
Reggie Wayne and Joseph Addai turned in good weeks.  The
Oppressors hurt by byes and missed updating their lineup
and started the out Pierre Thomas and Shiancoe on a bye
only managed 46 points and Jay Cutler was absolutely
manhandled by the Giants posting a -3.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ego Spengler (3 - 1) 76, KC Money Baroons (0 - 4) 70</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Spengler riding a huge game by LT against the Bills was
able to hang on for a 6 point victory over the Money
Barons who were hurt by an oddly ineffective Drew Brees
at home against the Panthers and Steve Smith who went out
with an injury.</p>
<p><strong>Rearden Steelers (4- 0) 92, Portland Agents Of Fortune (1 - 3) 63</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>MJD finally put up some big numbers to justify his pick
at #3 overall, and got consistently good numbers from
Philip Rivers and Roddy White putting together another
solid game to go to 4 - 0.  The Agents of Fortune got a
huge game from Calvin Johnson but Vick going out with an
injury held him to two points and Mike Sims-Walker
continues to disappoint with a 0 point week.</p>
