<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>As [noted yesterday](http://logicaldisconnect.org/archives/2005/11/27/a-worthwhile-sunday/) I ordered my new RAM.  And I have become accustomed to my Amazon orders getting here in one day, because I am a Prime member (so 2 day shipping is free), and all the things I order seem to come from a warehouse in Deleware, which tends to get it to Horsham in 1 day, and to me around 2 the next day.
Well my RAM shipped from [Sparks, NV](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=sparks,+nv&spn=1.350259,3.298096&hl=en) and the map shows my concern.  It doesn't look from that view, like anything could get out of that town in less than 3 days.</p>
<p>Well I guess it will still probably make it here by the 30th, but damn, I would have preferred sooner.</p>
