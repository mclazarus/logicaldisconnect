<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I have added, to my blog, a list of interesting links that I come across that aren't worth writing a whole entry about but I find interesting and worthy of sharing anyway.  I had this on my old <a href="http://movabletype.org">MT</a> site, but I didn't use it much because it was a hassle to update.  I happened across <a href="http://del.icio.us/doc/about">del.icio.us</a>, which bills itself as a social bookmarks manager.  Their simple interface and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet">bookmarklet</a> has made it easy to add links and they have a simple API for extracting an HTML version of the last 10 links added, so I threw it up on the sidebar of my page.  So make sure to check <a href="http://del.icio.us/mclazarus">it</a> out, from time to time.  And if you are one of those people who use an aggregator to read my site, then simply point at your aggregator at the <a href="http://del.icio.us/rss/mclazarus">RSS feed</a> to keep an eye on it.</p>
