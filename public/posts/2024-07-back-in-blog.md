I know posting about blogs in your blog is boring and annoying. But I must say I'm excited to have this system working and to be building myself a little ecosystem of tools that I can use to post to it.  Since I'm relying on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) for the hosting of this and GitHub actions to process and build it I'm now adding an Action to Drafts to let me post stuff very easily.

My real goal here is to try and get some of the connection value I used to get out of Blogs and Twitter way back in the day. I know a ton of people continued writing their blogs and I'm hoping to re-enter that space with my boring takes.

I know this is a big mess, and probably there was no reason to use Angular other than I wanted to learn it.  And I know there are broken links and posts everywhere and Blogs are dead, etc, etc.  But I don't care about any of that. I'm enjoying coding a side project. I know I'll learn from it and I'm enjoying at least the prospect of some connection.

So I moved this off of SquareSpace. They were fine, but I wasn't motivated to use it. Instead now that I have ownership of so much of the data and machinery in my Rube GoldBlog that I'm excited about it.  If you have an interest in telling me I spelled something wrong, or the way I'm using typescript is terrible. (See the code here: [mclazarus/logicaldisconnect](https://github.com/mclazarus/logicaldisconnect)) or any of the other things you're dying to correct me on, simply tell me on [The FediVerse](https://www.theverge.com/24063290/fediverse-explained-activitypub-social-media-open-protocol).  I hope to eventually support comments in this angular app, maybe they'll post to Fedi or something.  You can find me here: [@mclazarus@jawns.club](https://jawns.club/@mclazarus).

This post is what I call a two-fer. I post something and I also find out of the Drafts Action I wrote to post it works.  If so I'll be able to quick post from Drafts from my phone and that will be super fun.
