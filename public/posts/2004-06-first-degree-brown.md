  <p>On Saturday I tested for and received my First Degree brown belt.  This is the last belt before black.  I have a lot of work to do to acheive the first real advanced rank in our system, the black belt, but I am up for it.  The black belt test is scheduled for December 11.  And unless something unforseen happens I will be in the group testing.
Here is hoping that <a shape="rect" href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/500c727de4b0d820d6a42ad8/515f5893e4b0f7bed43ad1d5/515f59bde4b0f7bed43ae75f/1365203389131/000125.html?format=original">the critter</a> is accomodating to those 3 hours, since the <a href="http://www.4woman.gov/Pregnancy/duedate2.cfm?Month=3&Day=1&Year=2004&Submit=Calculate" shape="rect">dark art of birthday prediction</a> has chosen December 6th.</p>
<p>Thanks to my Chief Instructor, 4th degree black belt <a href="http://kickboxingcentral.com/" shape="rect" title="Villari's Trevose">Jim Wing</a> for sharing his knowledge in such an unselfish, supportive and enthusiastic way.</p>
