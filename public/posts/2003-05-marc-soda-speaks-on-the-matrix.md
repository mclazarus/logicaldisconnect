  <p>My good friend Marc gave his opinion on the Matrix today.  I met Marc at <a href="http://www.aspre.net/">ASPRE</a>, he is a damn fine <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/H/hacker.html">hacker</a> and one of the best security guys I know, so if you want to hire a top notch <a href="https://www.isc2.org/"><acronym title="Certified Information System Security Professional">CISSP</acronym></a>, just send me an email an I can put you in touch.  Anyway his comments follow:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first Matrix was done in such a way that it could be a stand
alone film or left open for sequels, just like the original Star
Wars.  Now that it's a trilogy, people need to take Reloaded in that
context.  The great thing about the original was the deep thought
behind it, the incredible action and effects where just the icing on
the cake.  If everyone is expecting some great new philosophy mind
fuck to emerge from this one, or even the third, then they'll be
disappointed.  Reloaded is building on a story already told, not
writing a new one.</p>
<p>Keep in mind I haven't seen it yet and it might really suck.</p>
