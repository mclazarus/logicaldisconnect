<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>The new release of <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/" shape="rect">firefox</a> seems to have a major bug in Linux.  If you browse to a secure site which doesn't have a pristine SSL cert, it locks it up.  I found the following <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=234969" shape="rect">bug</a> that appears to have been hijacked by 0.9 users to report this bug.  So either show me the real bug so I can vote for it, or everyone hop in create an account and vote for this bug.</p>
