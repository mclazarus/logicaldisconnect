  <p>Another change I've made recently to help with my overall health is to try using a scheduling infrastructure for my day. For about three weeks now I've been using the <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro Technique</a> to plan and track my activity throughout the day.  It's improving my productivity and also helping me lose weight.
This relates to my physical health in two ways, first if I spend my days full of anxiety about all the things I'm not doing I can never get physically well.  Second it makes me do push-ups.</p>
<p>That probably needs an explanation.  Pomodoro is a time-boxing technique that guides you to do 25 minutes of highly focused activity followed by a short 5 minute break.  In the <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/resources/ThePomodoroTechnique_v1-3.pdf">PDF</a> the author suggests it should be a real break from any thinking about work.  I found the transition from a hard thinking task to a state of mental relaxation to be very difficult to pull off, my mind–already warmed up to the topic–would wander back to the problem I was working on.  So I decided to do a set of push-ups to help me relax.</p>
<p>So far I've gotten better at pushups, squats, and sit-ups.  Oh, and I'm enjoying my productivity based primarily on the structure to my day.  It helps me concretize the idea that I can only do so many things in a day and helps me at the hard task of prioritizing my time.  It also helps me measure how long I take at certain tasks.  Since I chronically underestimate I welcome the opportunity to improve my judgement.</p>
