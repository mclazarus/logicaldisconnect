  <p>This article, in the form of a conversation, <a href="http://www.minimumeffort.com/nutshell.html">A warmonger explains war to a peacenik</a>, summarizes my view on the lack of justification for <a href="http://www.army.mil/operations/Iraq/default.html">Operation Iraqi Freedom</a>.</p>
<p>Luckily I was able to come across this article to this using my freedom-computer on the freedom-internet, looking at <a href="http://wilwheaton.net" title="WIL WHEATON DOT NET">WWDN</a>.  Time to get back to some freedom-work for my freedom-job.</p>
