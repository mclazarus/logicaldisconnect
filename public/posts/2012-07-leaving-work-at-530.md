<p>A few interesting things in this article.  </p>

<p>I don't advise playing the game Sheryl Sandberg was playing trying to look like she was working more than she was, but I certainly understand the pressure.  </p>

<p>Also really liked the idea attributed to Marrisa Meyer. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you resent the fact that you don’t eat dinner every night at 8 then you will get burnout and your work will not be as good.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact is you can only do so much so you have to ruthlessly prioritize.  And if you resent the fact that you can't do everything with unrealisticly high quality you'll just invite more pain and anxiety.</p>
