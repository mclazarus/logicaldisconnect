  <blockquote><p>I must not fear.  Fear is the mind-killer.  Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration.  I will face my fear.  I will permit it to pass over me and through me.  And when it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see it's path.  Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.Only I will remain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>-- The Bene Gesserit Litany of Fear from the novel Dune by Frank Herbert</p>
<p>To all the fear <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=monger">mongers</a> who work for the popular media companies:</p>
<p>I am not scared.</p>
<p>I don't care who you think has weapons of mass destruction, or what eating a specific food item will do to me, or how bad it's going to rain tomorrow.  At least not to the overhyped levels to which you are pumping these and other popular <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme">memes</a>.  Specifically when you provide no real news, other than a misinterpretation of a press release from the day before.  Do you feel even a little pang of remorse as you prey on fear to sell advertising space?</p>
<p><b>I am NOT scared.</b></p>
