<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Apparently my feed has been broken since Sometime in November.  At that time I upgraded wordpress, and possibly related was the merging of FeedBurner and Google.  Anyway It should be working now.  So for the 3 or 4 people who follow the feed, you will be delighted to know that I have been making an effort to add content regularly.  And strangely you have a little bit of catching up to do.  Unless you follow my tweets, then you probably already read all the posts.</p>
