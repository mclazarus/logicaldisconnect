<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>"The time is past when the notion of economic self-seeking and unrestricted use of profits made can be allowed to dominateâ€¦.  The economic system must serve the nation."
This could have been written in any editorial recently, and certainly a similar sentiment was spouted on Capitol Hill in the past weeks.  But it is a quote of the Nazi Minister of Economics in the book [The Omnious Parallels](http://www.amazon.com/Ominous-Parallels-Leonard-Peikoff/dp/0452011175/mclazarus-20/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1223927521&sr=8-1).</p>
<p>With the economic controls and the sacrifice of individual rights to the nation, we are putting a motor on our drift from freedom to fascism.</p>
