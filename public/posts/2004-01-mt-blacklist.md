<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>On <a href="http://www.ryangrier.com/">Ryan's</a> suggestion I am trying out <a href="/usr/local/share/doc/p5-Mail-SpamAssassin/INSTALL,">MT-Blacklist</a> to filter the spam.  Basically it takes blacklist I entered and compares any URL's in the ping or comment to the blacklist.  Any that match are discarded.  You can see my <a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/500c727de4b0d820d6a42ad8/515f5893e4b0f7bed43ad1d5/515f59bce4b0f7bed43ae74d/1365203388554/blacklist.txt?format=original">blacklist</a>.  It is the same as the <a href="http://www.jayallen.org/comment_spam/blacklist.txt">master blacklist</a>, except for one entry that was added by scanning my existing spam laden comments.
It seems this should work pretty well, at least against the ones I had been getting.</p>
