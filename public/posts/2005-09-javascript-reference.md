<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>A while back I noted that [devedge was dead](http://logicaldisconnect.org/archives/2004/10/20/netscape-devedge-dead/).  Well googling for some javascript stuff led me to the [Mozilla Developer Center, Javascript page](http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/JavaScript).  The [references link](http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Category:JavaScript:References) gives you the good stuff.
Thank you for getting this together finally.  Because it gives me a definitive source for this type of info.</p>
