<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>If you use a computer as much as I do there is something very refreshing about deleting old crap and clutter.  If you are a programmer and are responsible for thousands of lines of code, there is something great about deleting old, unused code.  It makes you feel so much more in control of the environment.  Very theraputic.
Today, I am taking nearly a whole day to delete old broken down code.  Gotta board up the windows and wall off the slums from the shiny code that actually does good work.</p>
