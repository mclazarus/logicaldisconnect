<p>I just contacted DELL about this - and of course, they told me that they don't support Linux, that there is fine print in their ad, etc.  I think everyone affected should get in touch with them and push three points:
1.  Dell MUST stop advertising E521 as a solution for "open-source customers". (http://www.dell.com/content/topics/segtopic.aspx/e510_nseries?c=us&amp;cs=19&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs)
At least until the problem is resolved.</p>
<p>2.  Dell MUST work with chipset manufacturer to resolve the problem.  It is in their own interest if they plan to keep selling these machines.</p>
<p>3.  Dell MUST contact customers that purchased E521 (especially the "n series") and notify them that they are taking steps to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>Listen, here is what their ad says:</p>
<p>"Are you looking for a desktop on which you can run LinuxÂ®  or other open-source operating systems? Look no further!"</p>
<p>Given the fact that they apparently never tried to test this computer with any flavor of Linux (freedos?  give me a break), this sounds like bad marketing practice.  </p>
<p>Regarding the price, I got this box for ~$700 (no monitor) through higher education institutional purchase program.  It is substantially cheaper than what other vendors would ask for  with the same configuration.</p>
