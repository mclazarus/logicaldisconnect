<p>Thanks Mark, yeah the find my phone I'll hopefully never have to use, but it's good to have.  And I do sync the preferences, so I'll probably stick with it for a while.</p>
<p>It's possible iCal can do it, I'll have to check that out.  When I first started with BusySync/Cal I could only do ReadOnly to the Google Calendar.  And I liked to be able to add events to my calendar without launching the site in my browser.</p>
