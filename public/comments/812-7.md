<p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>Yes, I suspect they feel entitled somehow to have whatever they want or need.  Granted some people are just jerks and that could explain it but this was a small practice and she would literally spend as long as needed with each family answering questions and explaining her medical judgements.  So it's not possible to question her dedication to her craft or feel she just grew tired of it.  To feel saddened is one thing.  To feel like you were unjustly wronged is unwarranted and wrong.</p>
<p>I suspect more and more of the better doctors will for various reasons need to flee to other careers or less risky positions.  Those that will flourish under the increasing regulations will be those you don't want.</p>
