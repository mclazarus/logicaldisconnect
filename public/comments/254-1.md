<p>Sorry :)
I have been going through a transitional period in my life, and the things I would like to write most about I am deliberately leaving out just so friends and colleagues can not be blindsided by information being available before they are ready to deal with it.   I know this is vague, and really it is not terribly interesting stuff in the grand scheme.  But I know my silence is appretiated on certain matters.</p>
<p>Not to worry though I plan to be really verbose starting in July.</p>
