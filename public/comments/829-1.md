<p>MobileMe still has Find My iPhone, and it syncs Safari bookmarks between iPhone, Mac and Windows (the latter can also use Internet Explorer bookmarks if you roll that way). Plus it's pretty much the only way to sync preferences and the Dock between multiple Macs.</p>
<p>I'm not sure why you're using BusyCal, though. Can't you just wire iCal to Google Calendar though the latter's CalDAV support?</p>
