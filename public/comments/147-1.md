<p>Nothing in particular.  I just had some stuff to say.  <a href="http://fanball.com/">fanball</a> site is a-ok.  And my tremendous 3 - 1 fantasy teams are off to a good start!
Actually secretly I am hoping some influential and rich people see my entries and say, "damn! you are a clever boy.  How bout we pay you twice your current salary to make witty comments on stuff a couple times a day."  I'll let you know how that turns out, and if I need an assistant.</p>
