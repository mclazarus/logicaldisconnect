<p>I completely agree with you. I've always been one to buy lunch everyday at a nearby fast food joint. But I've always had to waste about 30 minutes driving back and forth to those places. It would be much more convenient if they were within walking distances, for two advantages: 1) if you're buying your lunch and bringing it back to the office, you'll have more "free time" on your break; and 2) you could otherwise walk to get your lunch, and use your walking time as relaxation/thinking time.</p>
