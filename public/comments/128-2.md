<p>I understand the point, but its still just a matter of convenience.  And I have never taken advantage of it, however I still have been paying a couple a bucks a month for nearly 10 years now.  (I do not actually remember the portability charges on my first phone) but the point is, I have surely paid at least 200 to verizon by now so that I can have the convenience of moving my phone number.  Which the prospects of me ever using that feature are pretty small, and if I use it more than once I will be very surprised.
Anyway, that is why you can just fire out an email to everyone to update their speed dial stuff.  When I change addresses I need to contact everyone that I owe money to, and all the magazines that send stuff to my house and let them know.  I like the fact that there is a technology solution.  But if I could sign an agreement and opt out of paying that extra bit to the phone company for the inconvenience of notifying everyone that I changed phone numbers every once in a while (read: possibly every 5 years) then tell me where to sign up.</p>
