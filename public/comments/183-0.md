<p>Moreover the things that are presented to you as "healthy", 99 times out of 100 aren't.  Fruit and vegetables are genetically alter to grow fast and coat in and out with pesticides.  Meat and diary come from animals that are pumped full of growth hormones and antibiotics.  Even your drinking water is full of poisons like chlorine and fluoride.  All of these things in small doses are said to be harmless, but over the years these toxins build up and cause a host of ailments and tons of premature deaths.
Exercise and eat organic.  It's not, however, very convenient.</p>
<p>Where's the FDA?  In the pockets of the drug companies and food industry lobbyists.  That's what makes our government suck, greed.  Corporate greed is killing all of us.  Greedy people suck, thus many people suck.</p>
<p>I thought this would fit well under the misanthropic banner.</p>
<p>I going to go back to yelling at the wall now...</p>
