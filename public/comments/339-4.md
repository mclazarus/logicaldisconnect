<p>I do.  Hey, using it and [flickr](http://flickr.com/) to post stuff is quick and easy.  Plus it spices up an otherwise languising blog.
Don't worry the novelty will wear off soon enough and I will go back to ignoring everyone.  But a 1.3 MP camera that I can post pics from right away is sweet.</p>
