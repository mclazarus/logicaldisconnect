<p>Yeah they suck.  I didnt' even try the DSL.  The good news is someone there must understand something, eventually after they threatened to send me to collection and Michelle had to get on a call with them again and tell them how worthless they are, I did recieve a check in the mail for all the money I had paid them.  The bad news is I did lose my phone number.
But they will never be better than any other telco I have dealt with, the people they have answering the phones are low paid, under-trained, non-professionals.  The cry from them would be but people who are really good at taking the calls don't want to do it and turnover is too high to have highly trained people doing it.  All I can say to that is I'm glad it's not my problem, so I won't accept you making it mine.  Go rot with ATX and all the other jokes who keep trying to move in on the home telco market.  </p>
