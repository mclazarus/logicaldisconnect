<p>Kevin,</p>
<p>"I think the idea that makes people think they were right to yell at this woman is very closely related to the idea that makes them think they are right to force the doctors, insurance companies and ultimately their neighbors to provide healthcare under government coercion."</p>
<p>Well these people will get what they deserve but it's too bad that you and your family had to suffer for it.</p>
<p>They were screaming at the doctor? As the goverment expands its control, that type of terrible behavior is only going to get more common.</p>
