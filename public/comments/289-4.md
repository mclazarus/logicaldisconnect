<p>Starting out it will probably be 2D one screen games, little puzzle games, etc to get started and learn the APIs.  From there I am not sure, we'll see how things feel.  I have always liked those simple puzzle games so I may play with them for a while.  But I always liked some of the simpler side-scroll too, so I will probably play with them and wait until I get enough cash to afford a machine that can handle doing managed directX 3D stuff well. I have been playing with some of the 3D stuff already, I downloaded the Visual C# 2005 Beta from Microsoft, and the DrectX SDK and have been running through tutorials I found online.
