<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>I had gone completely off of my diet during the holidays.  Part of this was planned as I wanted to establish a baseline and then experiment.  And am convinced wheat is indeed poison.  The difference between my mood, energy level and all the gastric distress that is brought on when I introduce wheat into my diet is pronounced.</p>
