<p>I actually recently noticed that I'll sometimes have such a resistance to some very hard problem, that I will go hunting for a snack or a refill on my beverage, or to the bathroom.  This only happens when I have a particularly sticky problem.  Or one that totally blows away what I thought before.</p>
<p>I am not yet sure what causes that emotional resistance to dive into the new problem.  I think it's related to the fact that I know I'll get interrupted.  And the deeper and more complex a problem gets the greater the chance I'll expend effort only to have it wasted when I am interrupted and haven't yet figured out the solution yet.</p>
<p>I've been working to recognize that emotional state and to stop and ask myself the question, "What do you want?" when that happens.  I mean that question in the long term sense not the immediate, it has helped to keep me focused.</p>
<p>I think my long term strategy is to become more cantankerous when interrupted to train those around me when to leave grumpy Kevin alone.</p>
