<p>I just wanted to put my two cents worth in on the Ed Hoculi subject.  I think he is the best ref the NFL has.  When my team plays, I always keep my fingers crossed he will be on the field with us.  I always know it will be called a fair game.  I admire the dedication he puts into his work and his health.  I hope he is with the NFL for many years to come.  This fan appreciates it!!</p>
