<p>New alternator and battery, all told about $380.
When Michelle's car needed the same thing, but I was beholden to some crappy shop near the airport, and pretty sure I was getting screwed, I paid over $500.  (damn japanese cars)  This was of course a good 40k miles earlier than my car needed the same work.</p>
<p>So all in all I am not terribly upset.</p>
