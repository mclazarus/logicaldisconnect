<p>I know for a fact he has never touched a steroid and all he does besides work his you know what off is a, as in 1, protein shake a day.  Everyone who has guns and a chest like him doesn't necessarily do the roids.  He would never touch the stuff and with all the health consequences that go along with their usage, he ouwldn't put himself in danger like that...he wouldn't do that to himself nor his family.  Steroids are for cheaters (Bonds, Palmeiro. Lance Berkman, Sosa, Marion Jonesnad the thousands of other athletes trying to get ahead).  A great body can be obtained without cheating just as winning 7 Tour de Frances IN A ROW....amazing things happen when one puts their MIND to what they want to do and how they want to do it...the mind is more powerful than any steroid can ever be...besides it kills brain cells among other things.  If you are going to accuse someone of doing something. make sure you have the info to back it up..jealously doesn't cut it.  We make fun of that which we don't understand, so obviously you do not understand the anatomy and physiology of the human body and what resistance weight can do to the muscles of the body...wothout aid from an illegal substance.</p>
