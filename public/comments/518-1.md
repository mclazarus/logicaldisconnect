<p>That gnarly, charry old man was overdue.  There were two parts during the book when I was actually angry.
1. When Roland had his first run in with the lobstrocities.  I was mad, he didn't even really get a chance to show what he could do, well except for killing everyone in Toll.</p>
<p>2. When George Guidall was doing the audio book readings for books 5, 6 and 7.  Frank Muller was a genious, and his voice for Eddie Dean was awesome.  Not that George did a bad job, but Frank was the man.</p>
