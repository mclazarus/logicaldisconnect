<p>the LWV has historically been some of the ONLY coverage the state of Pennsylvania received information wise (at least in my hometown).  As I understand it though the League itself has dwindled drastically in numbers and essentially exists to author that list any more.  It's sad that PA doesn't get more vocal about these things.</p>
