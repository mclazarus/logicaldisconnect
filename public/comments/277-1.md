<p>Yep you are right about the Gunslinger, I found all that out recently in my rage.  Well the day I can get the 7th book is 8/17, then I will be listening away to that final one cruising toward the ending.
I figured if I were going to read some more King I would go after the books that tie into midworld somehow.  I also plan someday to get the Tower books in dead tree format and read them, but I have to give myself 10 or 15 years to make it interesting again.</p>
