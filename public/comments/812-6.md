<p>Just clarification, I didn't intend to question her dedication, rather was postulating a possible justification for anger at her by others for quitting.</p>
<p>I would agree.  In general I would expect people to choose less regulated industries or migrate away from industries as they become more regulated.  This is not based on any sources or studies I've read but I suspect numbers are available if someone were to go looking.  Although, I think, you may get a different kind of person migrating into that position.  Politicians instead of physicians.</p>
