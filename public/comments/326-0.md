<p>I think part of the reason I'm still looking for the BIG IDEA is that I'm haven't found anything I'm truly passionate about, like your current goal.  To put in the kind of work necessary you really need that love of what you do.  I have to believe there's something, otherwise I'm a pretty sad excuse for a human being.
Part of the problem is being passionate about something attainable.  For example, I probably won't be visiting any other planets any time soon.  ;)</p>
<p>Nice use of the word 'bailiwick' by the way.</p>
