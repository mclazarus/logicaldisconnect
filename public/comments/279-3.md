<p>Tom,
If Ed Hochuli makes one bad call against the Eagles this year, I'll be on the first plane to Iowa just to kick you a$$!!!  I'll only visit with you for the 10 minutes it'll take me to kick your a$$ so there won't be any need for you to clean up your place, have dinner ready for me or anything like that.  the TMCFL money will be used for my airfare &amp; any other expenses I have, &amp; it will not be returned!!!</p>
