<p>I believe it.  You can see it in the students too... they have a tendency to believe that in all issues, there are only two possible options. Opening their eyes to the middle ground is probably the hardest part of teaching freshmen. So, naturally, they believe that there are only two types of people: overedcuated bookworms with no social skills or understand of real life, and undereducated morons who are nonetheless more interesting but actually as smart as the bookworms.  I blame PBS, Disney movies, and dumb people for perpetuating the belief that no matter how smart you are, you're just as smart as everyone else. </p>
