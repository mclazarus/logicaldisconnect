<p>I think you should only be allowed to keep your telephone number if it can be made to spell out a cool word, or in the case of Big Kev's #, a cool near-word (856- Burglag).Of course, the coolness of something is pretty subjective, which is why the government quickly needs to establish my post as Minister of Everything That's Right.
