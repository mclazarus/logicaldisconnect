<p>Yeah, Iced Tea is good.  But too much sugar.  And I don't like the Crystal Light Iced Tea.  I guess the diet snapple's aren't too bad.
I guess I could always make real Tea or Sun tea and sweeten it with Splenda.</p>
<p>Actually that's not a bad idea, maybe I'll look into doing that today.</p>
<p>Thanks Aunt Judy!</p>
