<p>The commute wouldn't be so bad.  As GW showed us, you only have to be in Washington for about 20 days out of the year...However, I do stand by my husband's decision.  At this time in our lives, we are concentrating on our lovely children and on his current business endeavors.  We'll see what the picture looks like in 2012.</p>
