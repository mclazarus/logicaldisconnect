<p>I just want everyone to know that July 12 was the best day of my life.  I was finally given the wonderful opportunity to marry the man of my dreams and the entire day was magical.  The time spent planning and organizing, in the year and a half leading upto the wedding, was all well worth it.  I may not remember everything about the day, but I will always remember how happy I was on July 12.
Kevin, you mean the world to me.  I hope I can live upto all your expectations as your wife.  I want to fulfill every one of your dreams and desires.  Your intelligence, sincerity, sense of humor & kindness are just some of the reasons why I love you.  Just by thinking of you, I get a warmth throughout my body that reminds me how much I love you.  Thank you for not only the special day on July 12, but all the special days you have given me since we began dating way back on October 31, 1997.  I am so excited to spend the rest of my days as your wife.  I love you, Kevin, with all my heart and soul.</p>
