<p>My friend here at the workshop, Lee Klein, who i think is the best writer of our new crop, is a huge Kafka guy.  He's read everything ever by Kafka and insists that "Metamorphosis" is just the tip of the iceberg. He says that your best bet to appreciate Kafka is to read his other, less famous stuff.  Just food for thought.</p>
