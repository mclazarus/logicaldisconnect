<p>Even though I wasn't around for it, March 7, 1976 was my lucky day.  I couldn't ask for a kinder, sweeter, more gentler man to be my husband.  I love you so much!  Happy Birthday, Sweetheart.  I LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!
Allison's all ready to help you celebrate tonight.  We're working on her saying "Happy Birthday Daddy" but she's not quite there yet.  Hopefully by tonight. We love YOU!!!!</p>
