<p>I went to see Dr. Burchman today.  Even though I have periodontal disease he was very gentle with my cleaning.  I put off going to the dentist for 3 years because I was afraid.  Now I have found the best dentist.  I didn't have any cavities which was great now i just have to do better with my flossing in the future.</p>
