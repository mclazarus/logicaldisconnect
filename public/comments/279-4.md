<p>I hear that PJ.  I am 100% behind Super Ed Hoculi, he is my second favorite Ref.  (Mike Carey Rules!) But I love that Ed hits the gym, and I think anyone that thinks that he is using illegal supplements is quite daft.
Anyway, most of this drama played out in the comments on <a href="http://tom.mcallister.ws/" rel="nofollow">Tom's site</a> so I'll leave it there.  </p>
<p>I also love that the Ed Hoculi took time from his busy schedule to chime in on the issue.  I imagine you are someone who knows him too, so thanks for taking umbridge at our mad google juice that caused searches on Mister Hoculi to shoot our sites and Tom's misguiding headlines to the top.</p>
