<p>Typically reading paper books takes place while I am eating my cereal, and some bathroom time in the evening.  Otherwise, I just bought an iPod and an FM transmitter and got a subscription to audible.com so I can download audio books and put them on my ipod and listen in my car during the drive to and from work.
But you are right I don't have nearly enough time to read as I would like.  My book backlog is getting huge, I am trying to find a place to write down all the books I want to read.  And maybe all the ones I have read, so I don't accidently start reading them again, which has happened quite a few times with Heinlein novels.</p>
