<p>Actually, I didn't, I picked someone else based on some searches I did on realtor.com.  My wife called the office, but wasn't clear in who she wanted to talk to, basically said, "I am looking for a buyer agent," and the secretary put her on hold and this guy came on the other end.  She said he sounded okay, and I looked at his website.  I was intrigued that he had a PhD in chemistry, hoping that since he, at one time, was capable of the rational thought required to study chemistry in such depths, that he would still have some of those qualities.  Also he apparently has been doing it for a while so experience can't possibly count against him.  So far, so good I guess.  We had about a 4 hour meeting with him, where he gave us a great primer on investing in a home.  And I liked what I could see of his approach.  I will post a more thorough review once  I deal more with him.</p>
