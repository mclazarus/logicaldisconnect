<p>I did have the experience of actually speaking to the Customer Care Reps at Cavtel & they mostly sucked.  The only person who was able to "help" me was Shana, when I finally told her I was cancelling my service.  I still have to call back in 5-7 days to get their billing dept to send me a check for all of the money that they owe me but Shana was atleast able to tell me that it was CavTel's fault & not Verizon's.  By the way, this was after sitting on hold for 2 hours on Thursday & an hour on Friday, without really talking to anyone who could help me.  I was able to chat with individuals on the cavtel website for support but they did nothing to correct my problem.  CAVTEL SUCKS!!!!!!  But I guess that's how the saying goes "You get what you pay for."  I can see where Cavtel saves money in order to keep the cost to the customer lower.</p>
